Covers platform selection (Product Hunt, BetaList, Hacker News, Indie Hackers, Peerlist, DevHunt, Uneed, Fazier, MicroLaunch, Open Launch, TAAFT, Futurepedia, and the full long tail in references/platform-guide.md), launch sequencing (instant-list first, editorial-review last), backlink stacking (DA/DR comparison across directories), listing optimization, timing strategy, and multi-platform coordination. Use when not sure which directories are worth submitting to, launch didn't get traction, want more backlinks but don't know where to start, deciding launch order across directories, or overwhelmed by how many directories exist. Do NOT use for a single specific platform (use the platform skill instead). Do NOT use for paid advertising (use /sales-b2b-advertising)."

# Startup Directory Launch Strategy

Helps the user plan and execute a coordinated launch across multiple startup directories and discovery platforms — choosing which to submit to, in what order, and how to optimize each listing for maximum visibility, backlinks, and early users.

## Step 1 — Gather context


If `references/learnings.md` exists, read it first for accumulated knowledge.

Ask the user:

1. **What are you launching?**
   - A) SaaS / software tool
   - B) Mobile app
   - C) API / developer tool
   - D) No-code / low-code tool
   - E) Physical product or service
   - F) Something else — describe it

2. **What stage is your product?**
   - A) Idea / concept — no working product yet
   - B) MVP / prototype — functional but early
   - C) Launched — live with some users
   - D) Growing — looking for more distribution

3. **What's your primary goal?**
   - A) First users and feedback
   - B) SEO backlinks
   - C) Community visibility and social proof
   - D) All of the above

4. **What's your budget for paid listings?**
   - A) $0 — free submissions only
   - B) Under $50 — can afford one or two paid options
   - C) $100-500 — willing to invest in expedited/featured placements
   - D) Budget is flexible — optimize for results

5. **Any timing constraints?**
   - A) ASAP — want listings live as fast as possible
   - B) Coordinating with a specific launch date
   - C) No rush — steady rollout over weeks/months

**If the user's request already provides most of this context, skip directly to the relevant step.** Lead with your best-effort answer using reasonable assumptions (stated explicitly), then ask only the most critical 1-2 clarifying questions at the end.

## Step 2 — Route or answer directly

If the request maps to a single platform, route:
- Open Launch-specific questions → `/sales-openlaunch`
- CtrlAlt.cc-specific questions → `/sales-ctrlaltcc`
- MicroLaunch-specific questions → `/sales-microlaunch`
- LaunchingNext-specific questions → `/sales-launchingnext`
- ProductBurst-specific questions → `/sales-productburst`
- SoloPush-specific questions → `/sales-solopush`
- SideProjectors-specific questions → `/sales-sideprojectors`
- Huzzler-specific questions → `/sales-huzzler`
- Firsto-specific questions → `/sales-firsto`
- OpenHunts-specific questions → `/sales-openhunts`
- Tiny Startups-specific questions → `/sales-tinystartups`
- DevHunt-specific questions → `/sales-devhunt`
- TinyLaunch-specific questions → `/sales-tinylaunch`
- Uneed-specific questions → `/sales-uneed`
- Fazier-specific questions → `/sales-fazier`
- Peerlist-specific questions → `/sales-peerlist`
- Awesome Indie-specific questions → `/sales-awesomeindie`
- LaunchDay-specific questions → `/sales-launchday`
- Super Launch-specific questions → `/sales-superlaunch`
- JustGotFound-specific questions → `/sales-justgotfound`
- Altern-specific questions → `/sales-altern`
- StartupBase-specific questions → `/sales-startupbase`
- Startup Stash-specific questions → `/sales-startupstash`
- PitchWall-specific questions → `/sales-pitchwall`
- Futurepedia-specific questions → `/sales-futurepedia`
- TAAFT-specific questions → `/sales-theresanaiforthat`
- TopAI.tools-specific questions → `/sales-topai`
- Toolify-specific questions → `/sales-toolify`
- BetaList-specific questions → `/sales-betalist`
- LaunchCaster-specific questions → `/sales-launchcaster`
- SaaSHunt-specific questions → `/sales-saashunt`
- Resource.fyi-specific questions → `/sales-resourcefyi`
- LaunchVibe-specific questions → `/sales-launchvibe`
- Indie Hackers-specific questions → `/sales-indiehackers`
- Product Hunt-specific questions → `/sales-producthunt`
- Email marketing to subscribers → `/sales-email-marketing`
- Landing page optimization → `/sales-checkout`
- Audience growth strategy → `/sales-audience-growth`

- Comparing directory submission services → `/sales-directory-submission`
- Managed directory submission service → `/sales-getmorebacklinks`

Otherwise, answer directly from the directory knowledge below.

## Step 3 — Directory reference

**Read `references/platform-guide.md`** for detailed module documentation, pricing, integrations, and data model.

*You no longer need the platform guide details — focus on the user's specific situation.*

## Gotchas

*Best-effort from research — review these, especially items about plan-gated features and integration gotchas that may be outdated.*

- **Pricing changes.** All prices listed are best-effort snapshots. MicroLaunch Pro, LaunchingNext expedited, CtrlAlt.cc paid launch, and BetaList pricing may change. Verify before purchasing.
- **DR/DA numbers fluctuate.** Domain ratings change over time. The rankings above are directionally correct but exact numbers may shift.
- **Product Hunt is not a directory.** It's a launch event. Don't treat it like the others — it requires separate preparation, community building, and timing strategy.
- **"Dofollow" claims vary.** Some directories report dofollow but individual listings may vary. Always verify after your listing goes live by inspecting the HTML.
- **Editorial queues are unpredictable.** "Up to 2 months" is a documented worst case, not a guarantee. Some platforms review faster, some slower.
- **Small platforms have small traffic.** Most directories in this list have modest traffic (5K-25K/mo). Set realistic expectations — directory submissions are a long-term SEO play, not an overnight traffic source.

- **Self-improving**: If you discover something not covered here, append it to `references/learnings.md` with today's date.

## Before recommending a specific platform skill

This skill covers a strategy domain across many platforms. **Before pointing the user to any specific platform skill** (any `/sales-{platform}` listed in `## Related skills`, e.g., `/sales-mailshake`, `/sales-klaviyo`, `/sales-apollo`), read that platform skill's actual `SKILL.md` first. The 1-line description in `## Related skills` is enough to *identify* a candidate — it's not enough to *commit* to it or to write a prompt that invokes it well.

**How to read it:**
- If `~/.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` exists locally, `Read` it.
- For `sales-*` skills, `WebFetch` directly from this repo: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sales-skills/sales/main/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` — e.g., for `sales-mailshake`: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sales-skills/sales/main/skills/sales-mailshake/SKILL.md`.
- For non-`sales-*` skills (third-party), look up `{org}/{repo}` in `~/.claude/skills/sales-do/references/skill-sources.md` if installed and fetch the same `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` path under that repo.

**After reading,** ground your recommendation in something concrete from the SKILL.md (its scope, a sub-flow, its `argument-hint` shape, or a "Do NOT use for..." negative trigger). Align any generated invocation with the platform skill's `argument-hint`. If the platform skill turns out not to fit the user's situation, swap to another or handle the question here directly rather than recommending a poor fit.

## Examples

### Example 1: Plan a full multi-directory launch
**User says**: "I built a no-code analytics tool and want to launch it across as many directories as possible to get backlinks and early users"
**Skill does**:
1. Recommends Phase 1 instant listings: SoloPush, ProductBurst, Indie Hackers (live in hours)
2. Suggests Phase 2 paid fast-track if budget allows: MicroLaunch Pro ($39), CtrlAlt.cc ($39), LaunchingNext ($99)
3. Submits to all free editorial queues on Day 1 for long-tail backlinks
4. Plans Product Hunt launch for Week 3 after refining listing based on feedback
5. Sets up UTM tracking for each platform to measure which drives conversions
**Result**: 10+ directory submissions with staggered timing, 7+ dofollow backlinks, and clear measurement plan

### Example 2: Maximize backlinks on zero budget
**User says**: "I have no budget but want to get as many SEO backlinks from startup directories as possible"
**Skill does**:
1. Lists all free-submission directories sorted by backlink strength
2. Starts with instant listings (SoloPush, ProductBurst) for immediate backlinks
3. Submits to all free editorial queues (CtrlAlt.cc, MicroLaunch, LaunchingNext, SideProjectors)
4. Recommends Show HN for high-DR free dofollow backlinks and Indie Hackers for community engagement (nofollow but highest conversion)
5. Sets up Google Search Console to track when backlinks are indexed
**Result**: 8+ dofollow backlinks from free submissions, staggered over 1-3 months

### Example 3: Choose between directories for a specific product type
**User says**: "I built a Shopify app — which startup directories should I prioritize?"
**Skill does**:
1. Prioritizes directories where e-commerce/Shopify tools get the most traction
2. Recommends ProductBurst and CtrlAlt.cc (both have strong tool/SaaS categories)
3. Suggests MicroLaunch for the deals marketplace (Shopify merchants love lifetime deals)
4. Adds Shopify App Store as the primary channel (not covered by this skill but critical)
5. Plans Product Hunt launch timed with a Shopify app update or milestone
**Result**: Platform-specific priority list with rationale for each recommendation

## Troubleshooting

### Submitted to many directories but getting no traffic
**Symptom**: Listed on 5+ directories but referral traffic is negligible
**Cause**: Most startup directories have modest traffic (5K-25K/mo). Individual referrals may be single-digit daily visitors. The value is cumulative backlinks and long-tail discovery, not immediate traffic spikes.
**Solution**: Shift expectations — directory submissions are an SEO play (backlinks compound over months) and social proof play (listed on X directories), not a traffic acquisition strategy. For traffic, pair with Reddit, Hacker News Show HN, and Product Hunt. Use `/sales-audience-growth` for high-traffic acquisition channels.

### Not sure which directories to prioritize
**Symptom**: Overwhelmed by the number of options, limited time
**Cause**: There are 50+ startup directories. Submitting to all of them is time-consuming and most have diminishing returns.
**Solution**: Start with the 7 directories in the first-party skills list — they cover the range of backlink strength and models. Submit to instant-listing platforms first (takes 10 minutes each), then queue the editorial ones. If you have time for more, check the third-party platforms table. Prioritize by backlink strength and relevance to your product category.

### Listings going live at random times, ruining coordinated launch
**Symptom**: Wanted a coordinated launch but editorial queues approved at unpredictable times
**Cause**: Free editorial queues (CtrlAlt.cc, MicroLaunch, LaunchingNext) don't guarantee timing. Your listing may go live weeks before or after you planned.
**Solution**: Only coordinate timing on platforms you control: instant-listing platforms (SoloPush, ProductBurst) and paid fast-track options. Treat free editorial submissions as "bonus" listings that will go live eventually. Don't plan your Product Hunt launch around when editorial queues approve you — those are independent.
