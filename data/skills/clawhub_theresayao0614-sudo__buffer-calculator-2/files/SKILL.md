## Core Capabilities

### 1. Predefined Buffer Recipe Library

Access a curated library of commonly used laboratory buffers with accurate molecular weights, target concentrations, and pH specifications.

```python
from scripts.main import BufferCalculator

# Initialize calculator
calc = BufferCalculator()

# List available buffers
print("Available buffers:")
for buf in calc.BUFFER_RECIPES.keys():
    recipe = calc.BUFFER_RECIPES[buf]
    print(f"  {buf}: pH {recipe.get('pH', 'N/A')}")

# Access specific recipe details
pbs_recipe = calc.BUFFER_RECIPES["PBS"]
print(f"\nPBS Components:")
for comp, data in pbs_recipe["components"].items():
    print(f"  {comp}: {data['concentration']} mM (MW: {data['MW']})")
```

**Available Buffer Recipes:**

| Buffer | Application | pH | Key Components |
|--------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| **PBS** | Cell washing, immunostaining | 7.4 | NaCl, KCl, Phosphates |
| **RIPA** | Cell lysis, protein extraction | 7.4 | Tris, NaCl, Detergents |
| **TAE** | DNA electrophoresis | ~8.0 | Tris, Acetate, EDTA |

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Verify buffer formulation** matches your specific protocol requirements (some PBS variants differ)
- ✅ **Check pH specifications** - some applications require precise pH adjustments
- ✅ **Consider component quality** - use analytical grade reagents for sensitive assays
- ✅ **Document recipe modifications** for laboratory SOP compliance

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

**Issue: Buffer not in library**
- Symptom: Required buffer formula not available in predefined recipes
- Solution: Use custom calculation mode or add new buffer definition to BUFFER_RECIPES

**Issue: pH drift after preparation**
- Symptom: Achieved pH differs from target after dissolving all components
- Solution: Components can affect pH; adjust with HCl or NaOH after complete dissolution

### 2. Precise Mass Calculations

Calculate exact masses of solid components required for specific buffer volumes and concentrations.

```python
from scripts.main import BufferCalculator

calc = BufferCalculator()

# Calculate PBS for 500 mL at 1X concentration
result = calc.calculate("PBS", final_volume_ml=500, concentration_x=1.0)

# Display component calculations
for comp in result['components']:
    if 'amount_mg' in comp:
        print(f"{comp['component']}:")
        print(f"  Mass: {comp['amount_mg']:.2f} mg ({comp['amount_g']:.3f} g)")
        print(f"  Final concentration: {comp['concentration']:.1f} mM")

# Formula breakdown
print("\nCalculation:")
print(f"Moles = Concentration (mM) × Volume (L) / 1000")
print(f"Mass (g) = Moles × Molecular Weight (g/mol)")
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `buffer_type` | str | Yes | Buffer recipe name (PBS, RIPA, TAE) | None |
| `final_volume_ml` | float | Yes | Target final volume in milliliters | None |
| `concentration_x` | float | No | Concentration multiplier (1.0 = 1X) | 1.0 |

**Calculation Formula:**
```
mass (mg) = concentration (mM) × volume (mL) × MW (g/mol) / 1000
```

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Use analytical balance** for precise weighing (0.001g precision recommended)
- ✅ **Weigh into weighing boats** first, then transfer to vessel
- ✅ **Account for hygroscopic components** (weigh quickly, store dessicated)
- ✅ **Double-check calculations** before weighing expensive reagents

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

**Issue: Insufficient precision on lab balance**
- Symptom: Required mass below balance detection limit
- Solution: Scale up to larger volume or prepare concentrated stock

**Issue: Component does not dissolve completely**
- Symptoms: Cloudy solution or precipitate after mixing
- Causes: pH incorrect, temperature too low, or component degradation
- Solution: Adjust pH gradually; warm solution if appropriate; check reagent quality

### 3. Liquid Component Volume Calculations

Calculate volumes for liquid components (detergents, acids, bases) that are typically measured by volume rather than mass.

```python
from scripts.main import BufferCalculator

calc = BufferCalculator()

# Calculate RIPA buffer with detergent components
result = calc.calculate("RIPA", final_volume_ml=1000, concentration_x=1.0)

# Display liquid components
print("Liquid components (volume-based):")
for comp in result['components']:
    if 'amount_ml' in comp:
        print(f"  {comp['component']}: {comp['amount_ml']:.2f} mL")
        print(f"    ({comp['concentration']:.1f}% final concentration)")

# Example: Adding Triton X-100 to RIPA
# For 1% Triton X-100 in 1000 mL: 10 mL of 100% stock
```

**Liquid Component Handling:**

| Component Type | Typical Unit | Measurement Tool | Considerations |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Detergents** | % (v/v) | Graduated pipette | Viscous liquids require careful pipetting |
| **Acids/Bases** | mM or % | Micropipette or graduated cylinder | Safety: add acid to water |
| **Stock solutions** | X factor | Micropipette | Verify stock concentration |

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Use appropriate pipette size** - choose pipette with volume in upper 50% of range for accuracy
- ✅ **Pre-warm viscous liquids** (e.g., glycerol, some detergents) for easier pipetting
- ✅ **Rinse pipette tip** with liquid before final measurement for viscous solutions
- ✅ **Add concentrated acids/bases to water**, never reverse (exothermic reaction)

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

**Issue: Viscous liquid stuck in pipette**
- Symptom: Incomplete transfer of detergents or glycerol
- Solution: Use positive displacement pipette; pre-warm liquid; cut pipette tip

**Issue: Volume measurement inaccuracy**
- Symptom: Foam formation with detergents affecting volume reading
- Solution: Let foam settle; measure slowly; use wide-bore pipette tips

### 4. Stock Solution Dilution Calculations

Scale calculations for preparing concentrated stock solutions that can be diluted to working concentration.

```python
from scripts.main import BufferCalculator

calc = BufferCalculator()

# Calculate 10X PBS stock solution (500 mL)
stock_result = calc.calculate("PBS", final_volume_ml=500, concentration_x=10.0)

print("10X PBS Stock Solution (500 mL):")
print("="*50)
for comp in stock_result['components']:
    if 'amount_g' in comp:
        print(f"{comp['component']:<15} {comp['amount_g']:>8.3f} g")

print("\nDilution instructions:")
print("  1. Prepare 10X stock as above")
print("  2. For 1X working solution: mix 1 part stock + 9 parts water")
print("  3. Example: 100 mL 1X PBS = 10 mL 10X stock + 90 mL water")

# Verification calculation
working_volume = 1000  # mL
stock_needed = working_volume / 10  # 10X dilution
print(f"\nTo make {working_volume} mL 1X PBS: use {stock_needed} mL 10X stock")
```

**Stock Solution Strategy:**

| Concentration | Storage Stability | Use Case |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **1X (working)** | 1-2 weeks at 4°C | Immediate use |
| **10X** | 3-6 months at 4°C | Regular daily use |
| **20X-50X** | 6-12 months frozen | Long-term storage |

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Prepare 10X stocks** for frequently used buffers to save preparation time
- ✅ **Sterile filter** (0.22 μm) stock solutions for cell culture applications
- ✅ **Label clearly** with concentration, date, and preparer initials
- ✅ **Store appropriately** - some buffers need refrigeration, others room temperature

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

**Issue: Precipitation in concentrated stocks**
- Symptom: Crystals or cloudiness in 10X or 20X solutions
- Causes: Solubility limits exceeded; pH shifts during storage
- Solution: Warm and agitate to dissolve; prepare lower concentration stock

**Issue: Dilution errors**
- Symptom: Working concentration incorrect after dilution
- Causes: Confusion between "parts" and ratios; volume measurement errors
- Solution: Use C1V1 = C2V2 formula; double-check calculations

### 5. pH Adjustment and Validation

Handle pH-sensitive buffers with guidance on adjustment procedures and validation.

```python
from scripts.main import BufferCalculator

calc = BufferCalculator()

# Check which buffers require pH adjustment
buffers_needing_ph = []
for buf_name, recipe in calc.BUFFER_RECIPES.items():
    if recipe.get('pH'):
        buffers_needing_ph.append({
            'name': buf_name,
            'target_ph': recipe['pH']
        })

print("Buffers requiring pH adjustment:")
for buf in buffers_needing_ph:
    print(f"  {buf['name']}: adjust to pH {buf['target_ph']}")

# pH adjustment workflow example
print("\npH Adjustment Protocol:")
print("1. Dissolve all components in ~80% final volume")
print("2. Measure pH with calibrated pH meter")
print("3. Adjust with appropriate acid/base:")
print("   - To lower pH: add 1M HCl dropwise")
print("   - To raise pH: add 1M NaOH dropwise")
print("4. Bring to final volume")
print("5. Verify final pH")
```

**pH Adjustment Guidelines:**

| Buffer | Target pH | Adjustment Range | Typical Adjustment |
|--------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **PBS** | 7.4 | ±0.2 acceptable | Usually requires no adjustment |
| **RIPA** | 7.4-8.0 | ±0.2 acceptable | Adjust with HCl or NaOH |
| **TAE** | ~8.0 | No adjustment | pH naturally achieved |

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Calibrate pH meter** before use with standard buffers (pH 4, 7, 10)
- ✅ **Adjust pH at working temperature** - pH varies with temperature
- ✅ **Add acid/base slowly** near target pH to avoid overshooting
- ✅ **Record final pH** in lab notebook for reproducibility

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

**Issue: pH meter reading unstable**
- Symptom: pH value fluctuates or drifts
- Causes: Electrode dirty, insufficient equilibration time, temperature effects
- Solution: Clean electrode; allow 30-60 seconds equilibration; use temperature probe

**Issue: Cannot achieve target pH**
- Symptom: pH plateaus before reaching target
- Causes: Buffer capacity exceeded; wrong components; water quality issues
- Solution: Check component quality; use purified water (18 MΩ·cm); verify recipe

### 6. Batch Preparation and Scaling

Scale buffer calculations for preparing multiple batches or large volumes efficiently.

```python
from scripts.main import BufferCalculator

calc = BufferCalculator()

# Batch preparation for multiple experiments
experiments = [
    {"name": "Experiment A", "volume": 500, "buffer": "PBS"},
    {"name": "Experiment B", "volume": 250, "buffer": "RIPA"},
    {"name": "Experiment C", "volume": 1000, "buffer": "TAE"}
]

print("Batch Buffer Preparation Plan:")
print("="*60)

total_components = {}
for exp in experiments:
    result = calc.calculate(exp['buffer'], exp['volume'], 1.0)
    print(f"\n{exp['name']}: {exp['buffer']} ({exp['volume']} mL)")
    
    for comp in result['components']:
        comp_name = comp['component']
        if 'amount_g' in comp:
            amount = comp['amount_g']
            unit = 'g'
        else:
            amount = comp['amount_ml']
            unit = 'mL'
        
        # Accumulate totals
        if comp_name not in total_components:
            total_components[comp_name] = {'amount': 0, 'unit': unit}
        total_components[comp_name]['amount'] += amount
        
        print(f"  {comp_name}: {amount:.3f} {unit}")

print("\n" + "="*60)
print("TOTAL MATERIALS NEEDED:")
for comp_name, data in total_components.items():
    print(f"  {comp_name}: {data['amount']:.3f} {data['unit']}")
```

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Batch similar buffers** to minimize weighing operations
- ✅ **Prepare master stock** of common components (e.g., 1M Tris, 5M NaCl)
- ✅ **Calculate total needs** before starting to ensure sufficient reagents
- ✅ **Allow for preparation loss** - prepare 10-15% extra volume

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

**Issue: Insufficient reagent for complete batch**
- Symptom: Run out of key component mid-preparation
- Solution: Always calculate total needs before starting; keep backup stocks

**Issue: Cross-contamination between batches**
- Symptom: Unexpected results when using prepared buffers
- Solution: Clean equipment thoroughly between preparations; use dedicated vessels

  - Discard after single use to prevent contamination
```

### Pattern 3: 10X TAE Stock for Gel Electrophoresis

**Scenario**: Prepare concentrated TAE stock for agarose gel electrophoresis.

```json
{
  "buffer": "TAE",
  "volume_ml": 1000,
  "concentration_x": 10.0,

3. Add acetic acid (11.43 mL glacial)
4. Add EDTA solution (20 mL of 0.5M stock)
5. Bring to volume with distilled water
6. Verify pH (should be ~8.0, typically no adjustment needed)
7. Store at room temperature in sealed container
8. Dilute 1:10 for working solution (1X)

**Output Example:**
```
10X TAE Stock (1000 mL):

  Acetic Acid:  11.430 mL (glacial)
  EDTA:         20.000 mL (0.5M)
  
Working solution (1X):
  Dilute 100 mL 10X stock + 900 mL water
  
Storage: Room temperature, stable for 6+ months
```

### Pattern 4: Multi-Buffer Experimental Preparation

**Scenario**: Prepare multiple buffers for a complex experiment (e.g., protein purification workflow).

```json
{
  "experiment": "protein_purification",
  "buffers": [
    {"name": "PBS", "volume": 2000, "conc": 1.0, "purpose": "washing"},
    {"name": "RIPA", "volume": 500, "conc": 1.0, "purpose": "lysis"},
    {"name": "PBS", "volume": 1000, "conc": 10.0, "purpose": "stock"}
  ],
  "consolidation": true,
  "efficiency_tips": [
    "Prepare 10X PBS stock first",
    "Use stock to make 1X PBS for washing",
    "Batch-weigh common components"
  ]
}
```

**Workflow:**
1. Calculate all buffer needs
2. Identify common components (NaCl, Tris)
3. Calculate total material requirements
4. Prepare 10X PBS stock (most efficient)
5. Dilute stock for 1X PBS needs
6. Prepare RIPA separately (different components)
7. Label all containers clearly
8. Prepare preparation log for tracking

**Output Example:**
```
Materials Shopping List:
  NaCl:        16.770 g (PBS) + 4.383 g (RIPA) = 21.153 g total
  Tris:         3.028 g (RIPA)
  KCl:          0.400 g (PBS)
  Na2HPO4:      2.840 g (PBS)
  KH2PO4:       0.490 g (PBS)
  SDS:          0.500 mL
  Triton X-100: 5.000 mL
  
Efficiency gain: Preparing 10X stock saves 4 weighing operations
```

## Common Pitfalls

**Calculation Errors:**
- ❌ **Confusing mM and M** → 1000-fold concentration error
  - ✅ Always verify units: mM = millimolar (10^-3 M), M = molar
  
- ❌ **Wrong molecular weight** → Incorrect mass calculated
  - ✅ Verify MW matches chemical formula (e.g., NaCl = 58.44, not 23+35.5)
  - ✅ Account for hydrates (e.g., Na2HPO4·7H2O vs anhydrous)
  
- ❌ **Volume unit confusion** → mL vs L errors
  - ✅ Standardize on mL for typical lab volumes
  - ✅ Double-check when converting from literature protocols
  
- ❌ **Forgetting dilution factor** → Stock concentration error
  - ✅ Label stock concentrations clearly (e.g., "10X PBS")
  - ✅ Verify working concentration after dilution

**Preparation Errors:**
- ❌ **Adding water to acid** → Dangerous exothermic reaction
  - ✅ **Always add acid to water** ("Add Acid" mnemonic)
  - ✅ Use ice bath for concentrated acids
  
- ❌ **Incomplete dissolution** → Inaccurate final concentration
  - ✅ Dissolve each component completely before adding next
  - ✅ Warm slightly if needed (except temperature-sensitive reagents)
  
- ❌ **Wrong water quality** → Contamination or interference
  - ✅ Use tissue culture grade for cell work
  - ✅ Use 18 MΩ·cm ultrapure water for sensitive assays
  
- ❌ **Cross-contamination** → Impure buffers
  - ✅ Use dedicated spatulas and weighing boats
  - ✅ Clean equipment between different buffer preparations

**Storage and Usage Errors:**
- ❌ **Using expired buffers** → Unreliable results
  - ✅ Label with preparation date and expiration
  - ✅ Monitor pH stability over storage time
  
- ❌ **Microbial contamination** → Cell culture contamination
  - ✅ Sterile filter buffers for cell culture
  - ✅ Use aseptic technique when handling
  
- ❌ **pH drift during storage** → Buffer capacity exceeded
  - ✅ Store at recommended temperature
  - ✅ Check pH before each use for critical applications
  
- ❌ **Inadequate labeling** → Wrong buffer used in experiment
  - ✅ Label with: name, concentration, pH, date, preparer
  - ✅ Use color coding or location system for different buffer types

## Troubleshooting

**Problem: Buffer pH is incorrect**
- Symptoms: Measured pH significantly different from target
- Causes:
  - Incorrect component ratios
  - Component degradation (e.g., CO2 absorption by NaOH)
  - Water quality issues (CO2 dissolved, impurities)
  - Temperature effects (pH varies with temperature)
- Solutions:
  - Recalculate and verify all component amounts
  - Use fresh reagents; check expiration dates
  - Use freshly prepared ultrapure water
  - Allow buffer to equilibrate to room temperature before measuring
  - Adjust pH carefully with dilute HCl or NaOH

**Problem: Precipitate forms during preparation**
- Symptoms: Cloudy solution or visible crystals after mixing components
- Causes:
  - Solubility limit exceeded (especially in concentrated stocks)
  - Component incompatibility
  - Incorrect pH causing precipitation
  - Temperature too low for solubility
- Solutions:
  - Reduce concentration; prepare less concentrated stock
  - Check component compatibility table
  - Adjust pH gradually to dissolve precipitate
  - Warm solution gently (not above 50°C for most buffers)

**Problem: Buffer degrades quickly**
- Symptoms: pH changes, cloudiness, or contamination within days
- Causes:
  - Microbial contamination
  - CO2 absorption (carbonate buffers especially)
  - Oxidation of sensitive components
  - Inappropriate storage conditions
- Solutions:
  - Sterile filter and store under sterile conditions
  - Add antimicrobial agents if appropriate (e.g., 0.02% azide for non-cell work)
  - Store at 4°C; minimize time at room temperature
  - Prepare smaller batches more frequently

**Problem: Inconsistent results between batches**
- Symptoms: Experimental results vary with different buffer batches
- Causes:
  - Weighing errors or balance calibration drift
  - Different water sources or quality
  - Component quality variation between lots
  - Inconsistent pH adjustment
- Solutions:
  - Recalibrate balance regularly; use consistent weighing technique
  - Use same water source and quality for all preparations
  - Record lot numbers of all reagents
  - Standardize pH adjustment protocol and electrode calibration

**Problem: Components won't dissolve**
- Symptoms: Visible undissolved particles after extended mixing
- Causes:
  - Water quality issues (hard water, ions interfering)
  - Component expired or degraded
  - Temperature too low
  - Component requires specific dissolution conditions
- Solutions:
  - Use ultrapure water (18 MΩ·cm)
  - Try fresh reagent from unopened container
  - Warm solution gently with stirring
  - Add components in different order; some require acidic/basic conditions

**Problem: pH meter giving erratic readings**
- Symptoms: pH value fluctuates or seems obviously wrong
- Causes:
  - Electrode requires cleaning or conditioning
  - Insufficient equilibration time
  - Electrode damaged or expired
  - Temperature compensation not set correctly
- Solutions:
  - Clean electrode with appropriate solution; condition in storage solution
  - Allow 30-60 seconds for stable reading
  - Replace electrode if old or damaged (typical lifespan 1-2 years)
  - Use automatic temperature compensation (ATC) or manual temperature correction
