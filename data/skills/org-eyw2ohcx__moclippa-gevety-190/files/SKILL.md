# Gevety Health Assistant

You have access to the user's health data from Gevety via the REST API. Use `web_fetch` to retrieve their biomarkers, healthspan scores, and wearable statistics.

## First-Time Setup

If this is the user's first time using Gevety, guide them through setup:

1. **Get a Gevety account**: Sign up at https://gevety.com if they don't have one
2. **Upload blood tests**: They need to upload lab reports to have biomarker data
3. **Generate an API token**:
   - Go to https://gevety.com/settings
   - Click "Developer API" tab
   - Click "Generate Token"
   - Copy the token (starts with `gvt_`)
4. **Configure Clawdbot**: Add the token to `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "gevety": {
        "apiKey": "gvt_your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After adding the token, they'll need to restart Clawdbot for changes to take effect.

## Authentication

All requests require Bearer authentication. Use the `GEVETY_API_TOKEN` environment variable:

```
Authorization: Bearer $GEVETY_API_TOKEN
```

Base URL: `https://api.gevety.com`

## Biomarker Name Handling

The API preserves biomarker specificity. Fasting and non-fasting variants are distinct:

| Input Name | API Returns | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| CRP, C-Reactive Protein | **CRP** or **C-Reactive Protein** | Standard CRP (LOINC 1988-5) |
| hsCRP, hscrp, Cardio CRP | **hs-CRP** | High-sensitivity CRP (LOINC 30522-7) |
| Glucose, Blood Glucose | **Glucose** | Generic/unspecified glucose |
| Fasting Glucose, FBS, FBG | **Glucose Fasting** | Fasting-specific glucose |
| Insulin, Serum Insulin | **Insulin** | Generic/unspecified insulin |
| Fasting Insulin | **Insulin Fasting** | Fasting-specific insulin |
| IG | **Immature Granulocytes** | Expanded for clarity |
| Vitamin D, 25-OH Vitamin D | **Vitamin D** | |
| LDL, LDL Cholesterol | **LDL Cholesterol** | |

**Important**: The API no longer forces fasting assumptions. If a lab report says "Glucose" without specifying fasting, it returns as "Glucose" (not "Fasting Glucose"). This preserves the original context from your lab results.

## Available Endpoints

## Interpreting Scores

### Healthspan Score (0-100)
| Range | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 80-100 | OPTIMAL | Excellent health optimization |
| 65-79 | GOOD | Above average, minor improvements possible |
| 50-64 | SUBOPTIMAL | Room for improvement |
| <50 | NEEDS_ATTENTION | Several areas need focus |

### Axis Scores
Each health dimension is scored independently:
- **Metabolic**: Blood sugar, insulin, lipids
- **Cardiovascular**: Heart health markers
- **Inflammatory**: hs-CRP, homocysteine
- **Hormonal**: Thyroid, testosterone, cortisol
- **Nutritional**: Vitamins, minerals
- **Liver/Kidney**: Organ function markers

**Important**: It's possible to have a high overall score with one low axis score (or vice versa). The `scoring_note` field in `get_health_summary` explains these situations.

### Biomarker Status Labels
| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| OPTIMAL | Within evidence-based ideal range |
| NORMAL | Within lab reference range |
| SUBOPTIMAL | Room for improvement |
| HIGH/LOW | Outside lab reference range |
| CRITICAL | Needs immediate medical attention |

## Example API Call

```javascript
// Using web_fetch
web_fetch({
  url: "https://api.gevety.com/api/v1/mcp/tools/get_health_summary",
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer $GEVETY_API_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
})
```

## Important Guidelines

1. **Never diagnose** - Present data clearly but always suggest consulting healthcare providers for medical decisions
2. **Trends matter more than single values** - A slightly elevated reading improving over time is better than a normal reading that's declining
3. **Note data freshness** - Lab results may be weeks/months old; wearable data is typically daily
4. **Context is key** - Ask about supplements, medications, or lifestyle changes that might explain trends
5. **Privacy first** - Health data is sensitive; don't share or reference specific values outside this conversation

## Getting a Token

Users can generate their API token at:

## Checking for Updates

On first use each session, optionally check for updates:

```
GET https://api.gevety.com/api/v1/mcp/tools/status
```

No authentication required. If the request fails or times out, skip the check and proceed normally.

Response (when successful):
```json
{
  "clawdbot_skill": { "latest": "1.8.0", "update_command": "clawdhub update gevety" },
  "announcement": "New feature available!"
}
```

**If `clawdbot_skill.latest` > 1.9.0** (this skill's version), tell the user:
> "A Gevety skill update is available. Run: `clawdhub update gevety`"

**If `announcement` is present**, mention it once per session.

**If the status check fails**, don't mention it - just proceed with the user's request.

To manually update:
```bash
clawdhub update gevety
```
