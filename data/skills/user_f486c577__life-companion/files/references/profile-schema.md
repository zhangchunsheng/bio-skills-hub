# Profile & journal schemas

Canonical shapes for the files under `COMPANION_HOME`. **Don't hand-edit these** —
go through `companion.py` so writes stay atomic and consent-gated. `schema_version`
gates future migrations. Rule: an unknown/declined field is an explicit `null`
with a sibling `*_known:false` where relevant, so it is never re-asked.

## `profile.yaml` — slow-changing identity + preferences
```yaml
schema_version: 1

  pronouns: null             # optional; ask, don't infer
  timezone: Asia/Shanghai    # IANA zone. Drives daily timing + crisis-helpline locale.
                             # Resolve from their own words: `companion.py resolve-tz 柏林`.
                             # Never guess one — a wrong zone means the wrong country's
                             # helpline. No match → ask; leaving it null is the honest state.
  location: "São Paulo"      # the words THEY used for where they are (optional).
                             # Kept because a city names a country more reliably than a
                             # zone does, which matters for localizing crisis help.

  time: "07:35"              # local clock time; null if unknown
  time_known: true           # explicit false ⇒ never re-ask
  gender: male               # male|female — needed for BaZi 大运 direction (阳男阴女…)
  place: "Beijing, CN"
  lat: 39.9042
  lon: 116.4074
  tz_at_birth: "Asia/Shanghai"   # IANA zone NAME (not an hour offset).
                             # Pass to BOTH astro.py --tz and bazi.py --tz. Without it
                             # bazi resolves 節氣 on a Beijing clock and a non-UTC+8
                             # birth can get the wrong year/month pillar.
  conventions:               # frozen so charts regenerate identically

## `consent.yaml` — per-category, revocable
```yaml
birth:         {granted: true,  date: 2026-07-17}
relationships: {granted: null,  date: null}     # null = not yet asked
mood:          {granted: true,  date: 2026-07-17}
```

## `journal/YYYY-MM.md` — human-readable (one file per month)
```markdown
## 2026-07-17  (Thu) · mood 6/10 · energy: low
tags: career, interview-anxiety

这周有点累。散步之后好一些。明天有场面试，有点紧张。

> companion: Second time this month movement reset your afternoon. Front-load it?
```
The `> companion:` line records the reflection you gave, so continuity is
auditable and you don't repeat yourself.

## `journal/index.jsonl` — machine mirror (written atomically with the prose)
```json
{"date":"2026-07-17","mood":6,"energy":"low","tags":["career"],"themes":["rejection","recovery-via-movement"],"module_touch":["career"],"people":[],"crisis_flag":false,"file":"journal/2026-07.md","offset":142}
```
`mood` is an integer **0–10** (out of range is rejected, not stored — it would poison
every `trend` average, which is presented as a computed fact). It is `null` for
text-only entries, and `add-entry` returns a `dropped` list when `consent.mood` is not
granted so the drop is never silent;
`crisis_flag` lets `safety_scan`/`trends` scan cheaply; `people` powers
relationship pattern-tracking; `offset` points back into the prose.

## `state/continuity.yaml` — loaded first every turn
```yaml
rolling_summary: "最近在准备面试；散步能稳定情绪；…"
open_threads:
  - {thread: "周四的面试", opened: 2026-07-17, status: open}
recent_moods: [6, 4, 7]
updated: 2026-07-17
```

## `state/modules/*.yaml` — per-module cache
Each module **reads** `profile.yaml`+`continuity.yaml` but **writes only its own**
file (`destiny.yaml` = cached natal chart computed once; `career.yaml` = vectors;
`relationships.yaml` = tracked patterns). This ownership rule prevents modules
from clobbering each other.
