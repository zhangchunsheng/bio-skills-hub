## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Detection & Awareness
- NEVER use binary "Seen/Not Seen" detection; strictly use a **Gradual Detection Meter** (0-100%) that builds based on distance, light level, and speed.
- NEVER use standard `RayCast3D` nodes for massive amounts of vision checks; strictly use **`PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.intersect_ray()`** to query the PhysicsServer instantly and nodelessly.
- NEVER allow AI to see through solid geometry; strictly use raycasts between AI eyes and player sample points (Head/Torso/Feet).
- NEVER use a single sample point for visibility; strictly sample **at least 3 points** (Head, Torso, Feet) to prevent detection bugs when partially in cover.
- NEVER use static "Guard Paths"; strictly implement **Dynamic Investigating** where guards leave their route to check on suspicious sounds/activities.
- NEVER trigger "Detection" immediately upon line-of-sight; strictly use a **Detection Meter** with a decay rate to provide a "forgiveness window" for the player to recover.
- NEVER assume a random navmesh point is safe; strictly verify cover points by **Raycasting toward the Threat** to ensure geometry successfully breaks the line of sight.
- NEVER forget to pass the guard's own **RID** into the raycast exclude array; if omitted, the ray will hit the guard's own body, causing false blocking.
- NEVER run complex AI detection for off-screen guards; strictly use `VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D` to pause heavy logic for distant enemies.

### Systemic & World Logic
- NEVER use a simple `distance_to()` check for hearing; strictly calculate sound travel along the **Navigation Path** to determine if a wall blocks noise.
- NEVER make combat as viable as stealth; strictly ensure "going loud" triggers intense reinforcements or high-lethality states to preserve the stealth loop.
- NEVER hide the "Why" of detection; strictly provide immediate feedback via **UI icons (?, !)** or audio barks ("What was that?").
- NEVER ignore the return value of `intersect_ray()`; strictly check `is_empty()` first to prevent runtime crashes.
- NEVER assume a raycast won't hit the guard itself; strictly **exclude the guard's RID** from Query Parameters.

### Optimization & Performance
- NEVER tightly couple AI to player scripts; strictly use **duck-typing** (e.g., `if body.has_method("get_detected")`) so guards can spot decoys or dead bodies without brittle dependencies.
- NEVER maintain hardcoded arrays to trigger base-wide alarms; strictly add guards to a **"guards" group** and use `get_tree().call_group()` for dynamic notification.
- NEVER use standard Strings for AI state; strictly use `StringName` (&"alert") for O(1) pointer-level comparisons in high-frequency loops.
- NEVER bake massive NavigationMeshes synchronously; strictly use `use_async_iterations` to prevent main thread stalls during runtime bakes.
- NEVER rely on `Node.find_child()` during gameplay; strictly use **Groups** or exported references for O(1) player tracking.
- NEVER leave CollisionShapes enabled on incapacitated bodies; strictly disable them or move them to a "corpse" layer to prevent pathing interference.

## 🛠 Expert Components (scripts/)

> **MANDATORY reads** before implementing the matching system:
> 1. [stealth_patterns.gd](scripts/stealth_patterns.gd) — space-state LoS, cone DOT, hearing helpers
> 2. [stealth_ai_controller.gd](scripts/stealth_ai_controller.gd) — multi-sample rays + RID exclude + path-length hearing
> 3. [stealth_vision_cone.gd](scripts/stealth_vision_cone.gd) / [vision_cone_3d.gd](scripts/vision_cone_3d.gd) — cone authorship

### Original Expert Patterns
- [stealth_patterns.gd](scripts/stealth_patterns.gd) - Nodeless LoS, cone tests, AI_Audible bus, async investigate.
- [stealth_ai_controller.gd](scripts/stealth_ai_controller.gd) - Alert meter AI using PhysicsDirectSpaceState (not RayCast3D nodes).

### Modular Components
- [stealth_vision_cone.gd](scripts/stealth_vision_cone.gd) - 2D/logic cone helpers.
- [vision_cone_3d.gd](scripts/vision_cone_3d.gd) - 3D cone debug / query helpers.
- [visibility_manager.gd](scripts/visibility_manager.gd) - Player exposure / light gem aggregation.
- [light_detector.gd](scripts/light_detector.gd) - Light probe / overlap exposure.
- [sound_occlusion_manager.gd](scripts/sound_occlusion_manager.gd) - Occlusion / bus routing for AI hearing.

## Core Loop
1. **Hide / move** → 2. **Vision & light exposure** → 3. **Sound propagation** → 4. **Alert escalation** → 5. **Investigate / escape**

## Decision Trees

### Perception
| Need | Action |
|------|--------|
| LoS + exclude self/player RIDs | **MANDATORY** [stealth_ai_controller.gd](scripts/stealth_ai_controller.gd) + [stealth_patterns.gd](scripts/stealth_patterns.gd) |
| Light-scaled detection | [visibility_manager.gd](scripts/visibility_manager.gd) / [light_detector.gd](scripts/light_detector.gd) |
| Hearing through geometry | Path-length via NavigationServer (controller) + [sound_occlusion_manager.gd](scripts/sound_occlusion_manager.gd) |

### When to load modules
| Task | Load |
|------|------|
| Guard AI spine | patterns + ai_controller |
| Author cones | vision_cone scripts |
| Player light gem | visibility + light_detector |
| Loud world props | sound_occlusion_manager |

Do **not** paste long vision/alert/ability tutorials into the skill body — keep decision trees here and implement from scripts.

## Skill Chain

## Common Pitfalls
