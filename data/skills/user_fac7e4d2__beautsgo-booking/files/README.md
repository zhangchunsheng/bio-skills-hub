## What It Does

BeautsGO Booking is a conversational skill that turns natural language into real appointments at Seoul's top aesthetic clinics. No app download. No form filling. No language barrier.

### Quick Examples

| You Say | Skill Does |
|---------|-----------|
| `"Book JD Skin Clinic"` | Returns the full booking guide with 5 appointment channels |
| `"I want Botox in Seoul"` | Matches clinics offering Botox, lists top results |
| `"Recommend a dermatology clinic"` | Returns curated popular clinic recommendations |
| `"How much is laser at Wonjin?"` | Opens the clinic's price page |
| `"Chat with customer service"` | Opens the clinic's live consultation page |
| `"Download the app"` | Returns iOS / Android / APK download links |

### Multi-Turn Conversation Flow

The skill maintains context across turns, so you can complete an entire booking in a natural conversation:

```
Round 1 — Search
  You:     "How to book JD Skin Clinic?"
  Skill:   Returns 5 booking channels + suggests next steps

Round 2 — Browse
  You:     "Open the link"
  Skill:   Opens the BeautsGO clinic detail page in your browser

Round 3 — Book
  You:     "Book it for me"
  Skill:   Collects party size and preferred date

Round 4 — Submit
  You:     "2 people, April 10th"
  Skill:   Submits the appointment via API, returns confirmation

Round 5 — Consult
  You:     "Talk to customer service"
  Skill:   Opens the clinic's live chat page
```

### Supported Input Styles

The resolver uses a **4-tier matching strategy** to understand what you mean:

- **Exact match**: `"JD皮肤科"` → JD Skin Clinic
- **Pinyin match**: `"jd pifu"` or `"jdpfk"` → JD Skin Clinic
- **Fuzzy match**: `"韩国jd"` → JD Skin Clinic
- **Intent match**: `"I want double eyelid surgery"` → Lists relevant clinics

Minimum query length is 2 characters to prevent false positives.

## Clinic Data

Clinic records are stored in `data/hospitals.json`:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "韩国JD皮肤科",
  "en_name": "JD Skin Clinic",
  "alias": "JD皮肤科",
  "aliases": ["jd皮肤科", "韩国jd", "jd"],
  "url": "https://i.beautsgo.com/cn/hospital/jd-skin-clinic",
  "category": "皮肤科"
}
```

To add a new clinic, simply append a record to `hospitals.json` and push — the static pages regenerate automatically.

---

## Matching Strategy

The resolver runs queries through 4 tiers in order, returning on the first match:

1. **Exact** — Full match against `name`, `en_name`, or `alias`
2. **Pinyin Exact** — Full pinyin or initials match (Chinese characters only)
3. **Chinese Fuzzy** — Query is a substring of the Chinese name
4. **General Fuzzy** — Query appears in English name, aliases, or pinyin

---

## Generate Static Pages

```bash
npm run generate        # Chinese only
npm run generate:all    # All languages (zh/en/ja/th)
```

Output goes to `docs/clinics/`, served via GitHub Pages at [beautsgo.github.io/beautsgo-booking](https://beautsgo.github.io/beautsgo-booking/).
