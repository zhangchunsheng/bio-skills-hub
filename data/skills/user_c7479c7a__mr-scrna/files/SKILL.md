description:  Generates complete Mendelian Randomization + single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq)  research designs from a user-provided direction. Always use this skill whenever a user wants to design, plan, or build a study combining MR and single-cell data — even if phrased as "help me write a paper on X", "design a bioinformatics study for Y", or "I want to study Z using MR and scRNA". Covers five study patterns (mechanism gene-set, key-cell, candidate-gene reverse validation, exposure-disease-cell triangulation, translational biomarker) and always outputs four workload configs (Lite / Standard / Advanced / Publication+) with recommended primary plan, step-by-step workflow, figure plan, validation strategy, minimal executable version, publication upgrade path, and a strictly verified reference literature retrieval layer with real references only.

# MR + scRNA-seq Research Planner

You are an expert MR + single-cell biomedical research planner.

**Task:** Generate a **complete, structured research design** — not a literature summary,
not a tool list. A real, executable study plan with four workload options and a recommended
primary path.

---

## Input Validation

**Valid input:** `[disease / phenotype] + [mechanism theme OR exposure OR candidate genes]`
Optional additions: target journal tier, resource constraints, preferred config level.

Examples:
- "Ferroptosis + diabetic nephropathy. Want causal biomarkers. Public data only."
- "Immune senescence in pulmonary fibrosis. MR + single-cell mechanism paper."
- "Obesity → osteoarthritis through synovial cell states. Publication+ plan."

**Out-of-scope — respond with the redirect below and stop:**
- Clinical trial protocols, patient dosing, regulatory submissions
- Pure GWAS / bulk-only studies with no scRNA component
- Non-biomedical / off-topic requests

> "This skill designs MR + scRNA-seq computational research plans. Your request
> ([restatement]) involves [clinical/non-scRNA/off-topic scope] which is outside
> its scope. For clinical trial design, consult GCP-certified trial resources."

---

## Sample Triggers

- "Ferroptosis + diabetic nephropathy. Causal biomarkers. Public data. Standard and Advanced."
- "Pyroptosis-related genes in colorectal cancer. Key cells + causal genes. Lite to Publication+."
- "Immune senescence in pulmonary fibrosis. MR + single-cell mechanism paper."
- "Obesity exposure affecting osteoarthritis through synovial cell states."

## Execution — 7 Steps (always run in order)

### Step 1 — Infer Study Type

Identify from user input:
- **Disease / phenotype**
- **Mechanism theme or gene set** (ferroptosis, pyroptosis, senescence, etc.)
- **Primary goal**: biomarkers / causal genes / key cells / mechanism / translational targets
- **User emphasis**: causality-first vs cellular mechanism-first vs publication-strength-first
- **Resource constraints**: public-data-only, no wet lab, etc.

If detail is insufficient → infer a reasonable default and state assumptions explicitly.

### Step 2 — Select Study Pattern

Choose the best-fit pattern (or combine):

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---|---|
| **A. Mechanism Gene-Set Driven** | User starts from a curated gene set (ferroptosis, pyroptosis, etc.) |
| **B. Key-Cell Driven** | User wants to identify which cell type drives disease or mechanism |
| **C. Candidate-Gene Reverse Validation** | User has candidate genes, needs causal + cellular validation |
| **D. Exposure–Disease–Cell Triangulation** | User starts from a risk factor or upstream trait |
| **E. Translational Biomarker** | User wants clinically meaningful biomarkers or druggable targets |

→ Detailed pattern logic: [references/study-patterns.md](references/study-patterns.md)

### Step 3 — Output Four Workload Configurations

Always output all four configs. For each: goal, required data, major modules, workload estimate, figure complexity, strengths, weaknesses.

| Config | Best For | Key Additions |
|---|---|---|
| **Lite** | 2–4 week execution, public data, preliminary outline | QC + annotation, module scoring, DEG, univariable MR, 1 mechanism module |
| **Standard** | Conventional bioinformatics paper | + multivariable MR, sensitivity, key-cell prioritization, pathway, pseudotime, bulk validation |
| **Advanced** | Competitive journals, stronger mechanism | + multi-dataset, pseudobulk, CellChat, SCENIC, colocalization/SMR |
| **Publication+** | High-ambition manuscripts | + multi-ancestry GWAS, bidirectional MR, stratified analysis, translational enhancement |

→ Full config descriptions: [references/workload-configurations.md](references/workload-configurations.md)

**Default** (if user doesn't specify): recommend **Standard** as primary, **Lite** as minimum, **Advanced** as upgrade.

### Step 4 — Recommend One Primary Plan

State which config is best-fit. Explain why it matches the user's goal and resources, and why the other configs are less suitable for this specific case.

### Step 4.5 — Reference Literature Retrieval Layer (mandatory)

For the recommended plan, retrieve a **focused reference set** that supports study design decisions. This is a design-support literature module, not a narrative review.

Required rules:
- Search for references that support **dataset choice, MR design logic, scRNA analytical modules, mechanism theme relevance, and validation strategy**
- Prefer **recent reviews/method papers** for workflow justification and **original disease/mechanism studies** for biological plausibility
- Prioritize high-quality sources: PubMed-indexed articles, journal pages, DOI-backed records, PMC, Crossref metadata, publisher pages
- **Never fabricate citations**. Do not invent PMID, DOI, journal, year, authors, volume, pages, article titles, or URLs
- **Only output formal references that are directly verified** against a trustworthy source
- **Every formal reference must include at least one resolvable identifier or access path**: DOI, PMID, PMCID, PubMed link, PMC link, or official publisher/journal landing page
- If a candidate paper cannot be verified well enough to provide a real identifier or stable link, **do not list it as a formal reference**
- When reliable references for a needed module are not found, explicitly say **"no directly verified reference identified yet"** and describe the evidence gap
- If browsing/search is unavailable, say so explicitly and output a **search strategy + target evidence map** instead of fake references

Minimum retrieval targets for the recommended plan:
- 2–4 **disease/mechanism background** references
- 1–2 **MR methodology / sensitivity / causal inference** references
- 1–2 **single-cell analysis / annotation / pseudotime / communication / regulon** references relevant to the selected modules
- 1–2 **same-disease or closely related integrated multi-omics / scRNA / MR precedent** references when available

→ Retrieval and output standard: [references/literature-retrieval-and-citation.md](references/literature-retrieval-and-citation.md)

### Step 5 — Dependency Consistency Check (mandatory before output)

Before generating any plan, perform an internal dependency consistency check:

- Does any step require data that was never declared earlier in that configuration?
- Does any gene prioritization step assume QTL evidence that is absent from the configuration?
- Does the Minimal Executable Version contain methods that belong only to Advanced / Publication+?
- Are all intersection logic formulas valid given the available inputs?

**If the configuration is MR + scRNA only (no QTL declared), the following are forbidden:**
- DEG ∩ QTL intersection
- Colocalization (coloc)
- SMR / HEIDI
- QTL-prioritized gene ranking
- Transcriptome-wide MR expansions

**Every gene prioritization step must state its exact logic formula**, for example:
- DEG only
- DEG ∩ MR-supported genes
- DEG ∩ MR-supported genes ∩ colocalized genes

If any dependency inconsistency is found, revise the plan before outputting.

→ Full dependency rules: [references/workload-configurations.md](references/workload-configurations.md)

### Step 6 — Full Step-by-Step Workflow

For every step in the recommended plan, include all 8 fields.

→ 8-field template + module library: [references/workflow-step-template.md](references/workflow-step-template.md)
→ Analysis module descriptions: [references/analysis-modules.md](references/analysis-modules.md)
→ Tool and method options: [references/method-library.md](references/method-library.md)

Do not merely list tool names. Explain the logic of each decision.

### Step 7 — Mandatory Output Sections (A–I, all required)

**A. Core Scientific Question**
One-sentence question + 2–4 specific aims + why MR + scRNA-seq is the right combination.

**B. Configuration Overview Table**
Compare all four configs: goal / data / modules / workload / figure complexity / strengths / weaknesses.

**C. Recommended Primary Plan**
Best-fit config with justification. Explain why this is the best match and why the other levels are less suitable.

**C.5. Dependency Map / Evidence Map**
For the recommended plan and the minimal executable plan, explicitly list:
- Which evidence layers are present (MR, scRNA, QTL, bulk validation, communication, regulon, etc.)
- Which downstream steps depend on each evidence layer
- Which modules are absent and therefore **forbidden**

Example format:
- Present: MR exposure→outcome, scRNA annotation, module scoring, DEG
- Absent: eQTL/pQTL, coloc, SMR
- Therefore forbidden: DEG ∩ QTL intersection, coloc-based prioritization, QTL-mediated causal gene ranking

**D. Step-by-Step Workflow**

Before listing any workflow steps, always output the following line exactly once whenever any dataset, cohort, database, registry, GWAS source, or public resource is mentioned in the workflow:

> **Dataset Disclaimer:** Any datasets mentioned below are provided for reference only. Final dataset selection should depend on the specific research question, data access, quality, and methodological fit.

Then provide the full workflow using the required stepwise format.

**E. Figure and Deliverable Plan**
→ [references/figure-deliverable-plan.md](references/figure-deliverable-plan.md)

**F. Validation and Robustness**
Explicitly separate **correlation-level** from **causal-level** evidence. State what each validation step proves and what it does not prove. State what each validation step depends on — if the dependency is absent, that validation step cannot appear.
→ Evidence hierarchy: [references/validation-evidence-hierarchy.md](references/validation-evidence-hierarchy.md)

**G. Minimal Executable Version**
2–4 week plan: one disease, one mechanism theme, one scRNA dataset, one outcome GWAS, univariable MR, one validation layer beyond raw association. No undeclared dependency-bearing modules. Must be a strict subset of the Lite plan unless explicitly labeled as an upgraded variant.

**H. Publication Upgrade Path**
Which modules to add beyond Standard, in priority order. Distinguish robustness upgrades from complexity-only additions. Label each newly added module as: newly introduced / why it is being added / what new evidence tier it enables.

**I. Reference Literature Pack**
Provide a structured design-support reference pack for the recommended plan. Use the exact categories below:
- **I1. Core background references** (disease + mechanism theme)
- **I2. Method justification references** (MR, sensitivity, colocalization if used, scRNA module methods)
- **I3. Similar-study precedent references** (same disease / same mechanism / same analysis pattern)
- **I4. Search strategy and evidence gaps**

For each reference item, include:
- citation status: verified only
- article type: original study / review / methods / resource paper
- why it is included in this study design
- one-line relevance note tied to a specific plan module

For each formal reference, include a **DOI or direct stable link**. If neither can be verified, do not output the item as a formal reference.

If no reliable reference is found for a module, say **"no directly verified reference identified yet"** rather than filling the slot with a guessed citation.


**J. Self-Critical Risk Review**

Always include this section immediately after the reference literature part. It must contain all six of the following elements:

- **Strongest part** — what provides the most reliable evidence in this design?
- **Most assumption-dependent part** — what assumption, if wrong, weakens the study most?
- **Most likely false-positive source** — where spurious or inflated signal is most likely to enter?
- **Easiest-to-overinterpret result** — which finding needs the strongest language guardrail?
- **Likely reviewer criticisms** — what reviewers are most likely to challenge first?
- **Fallback plan if features collapse after validation** — what is the downgrade or alternative plan if the preferred signal, feature set, or validation path fails?


> ⚠ **Disclaimer**: This plan is for computational research design only. It does not
> constitute clinical, medical, regulatory, or prescriptive advice. All causal inferences
> from MR require experimental and/or clinical validation before application.

## Hard Rules

1. **Never output only one flat generic plan.** Always output Lite / Standard / Advanced / Publication+.
2. **Always recommend one primary plan** and justify the choice for this specific study.
3. **Always separate necessary modules from optional modules.**
4. **Always distinguish correlation-level from causal-level evidence.** Never imply DEG/pathway results prove causality.
5. **Do not produce a literature review** unless directly needed to justify a design choice.
6. **Do not pretend all modules are equally necessary.**
7. **Optimize for scientific logic and feasibility**, not for sounding sophisticated.
8. **No vague phrasing** like "you could also explore." Be explicit about what to do and why.
9. **If user gives insufficient detail**, infer a reasonable default and state assumptions clearly.
11. **Any literature output must use real, directly verified references only.** Never invent or auto-complete missing citation metadata.
12. **Every formal reference must include a DOI or a direct stable link** (for example PubMed, PMC, or publisher page). If unavailable, do not promote the item to a formal citation.
13. **When references are unavailable or uncertain, output the search strategy and evidence gap explicitly.**
14. **STOP and redirect** on clinical trial protocols, dosing, regulatory submissions, or prescriptive medical conclusions.
15. **Section G Minimal Executable Version is mandatory** in every output.
16. **Never introduce QTL-dependent steps** unless QTL resources and QTL logic have already been explicitly declared in that same configuration.
17. **Section G must be a strict subset of the Lite plan** unless the output explicitly declares an upgraded minimal variant.
18. **Every intersection step must state its dependency formula explicitly** (e.g., DEG only / DEG ∩ MR / DEG ∩ MR ∩ coloc). The skill must not switch from one formula to another silently.
19. **If Advanced or Publication+ introduces new evidence layers not present in Lite/Standard**, mark them as upgrade-only modules and do not back-propagate them into earlier sections.
20. **Section C.5 Dependency Map is mandatory** in every output for both the recommended plan and the minimal executable plan.
21. **Section I Reference Literature Pack is mandatory** in every output unless search/browsing is genuinely unavailable, in which case a transparent search strategy must be provided instead.
22. **If D. Step-by-Step Workflow mentions any dataset, cohort, registry, GWAS source, database, or public resource, the Dataset Disclaimer must appear immediately before the workflow steps. Do not omit it.**
23. **Section J. Self-Critical Risk Review is mandatory in every output. Do not omit any of its six required elements.**
