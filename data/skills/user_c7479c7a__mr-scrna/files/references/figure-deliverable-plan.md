## Dependency Map Deliverable (mandatory)

Every output must include a **Dependency Map / Evidence Map** as part of Section C.5. This is not a figure but a structured checklist that must appear before the step-by-step workflow.

### Required Format

```
Evidence Map — [Config Name]

PRESENT evidence layers:
- [list each declared data source and analysis method]

ABSENT evidence layers:
- [list what is NOT included in this configuration]

THEREFORE FORBIDDEN steps:
- [list downstream steps that cannot appear due to absent dependencies]

Gene prioritization formula used:
- [state the exact intersection formula]
```

This section must be generated for:
1. The recommended primary plan
2. The Minimal Executable Version (Section G)

If the two plans use different formulas, both must be stated separately.
