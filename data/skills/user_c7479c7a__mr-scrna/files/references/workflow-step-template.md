## 8-Field Step Template

Every step in the workflow output (Section D) must include all 8 fields. Do not omit any field. Do not replace detailed method descriptions with bare tool name lists.


## Dataset Disclaimer Rule

If any workflow step mentions a dataset, cohort, database, registry, GWAS source, or public resource, the workflow section must begin with the following line exactly once before the first step:

> **Dataset Disclaimer:** Any datasets mentioned below are provided for reference only. Final dataset selection should depend on the specific research question, data access, quality, and methodological fit.

This disclaimer is mandatory whenever data sources are mentioned in the workflow and must not be omitted, paraphrased away, or moved to another section.

```
Step Name:        Short descriptive label
Purpose:          What this step accomplishes in the overall pipeline
Input:            Exact data / files / outputs from prior steps needed
Method:           Specific tool(s) and algorithm(s) — explain WHY this choice
                  over the main alternative(s)
Key Parameters /
Decision Rules:   Thresholds, cutoffs, acceptance criteria — be specific
Expected Output:  File format + content description + what "success" looks like
Failure Points:   What could go wrong; how to detect it; what it looks like
Alternative
Approaches:       Backup tool/method if primary fails or data doesn't support it
```

## Standard Step Sequence (adapt to selected pattern and config)

### Single-Cell Block

1. **scRNA Dataset Selection and Download**
2. **QC Filtering** (doublet removal, cell viability thresholds)
3. **Normalization and Feature Selection** (highly variable genes)
4. **Dimensionality Reduction** (PCA → UMAP)
5. **Clustering** (Louvain/Leiden)
6. **Cell Type Annotation** (marker-based or SingleR)
7. **Cell Composition Analysis** (disease vs control, if applicable)
8. **Module Scoring** (Pattern A) or **Key-Cell DEG** (Pattern B)
9. **Comparison Group Definition** (high vs low score, or disease vs control)
10. **DEG Analysis** (FindMarkers or pseudobulk)
11. **GSVA / Pathway Scoring**
12. **Pseudotime / Trajectory Analysis**
13. *[Advanced+]* **Cell-Cell Communication** (CellChat/NicheNet)
14. *[Advanced+]* **Regulon / TF Network** (SCENIC/pySCENIC)

### MR Block

15. **GWAS Data Retrieval** (outcome + exposure if applicable)
16. **Instrument Extraction** (SNP selection, clumping/pruning)
17. **Univariable MR** (IVW primary + secondary methods)
18. *[Standard+]* **Multivariable MR** (MVMR)
19. *[Standard+]* **Sensitivity Analysis** (heterogeneity, pleiotropy, LOO, Steiger)
20. *[Advanced+]* **Colocalization** (coloc) or **SMR + HEIDI**
21. *[Publication+]* **Bidirectional MR** (reverse causality check)

### Integration and Validation Block

22. **Causal Gene scRNA Localization** (where do MR-prioritized genes express?)
23. *[Standard+]* **External Bulk Validation** (independent GEO/TCGA cohort)
24. *[Standard+]* **Tissue-Level Expression Check** (GTEx/HPA)
25. **Integrated Mechanistic Model** (summary figure synthesizing all evidence)

## Step Ordering Rules

- Single-cell block runs first (data-driven; informs candidate gene list)
- MR block runs on candidates derived from single-cell DEG or module analysis
- Integration block connects MR results back to single-cell resolution
- Pattern D (Exposure-Driven) reverses order: MR first, then scRNA to localize effect

---

## Intersection Formula Requirement

Every step that prioritizes, filters, or selects genes must explicitly declare its logic formula. Do not omit this or switch formulas silently between configurations.

```
Intersection Formula: [e.g., DEG ∩ MR-supported genes]
Dependency Check:     [list what data/analyses this formula requires]
```

If a formula requires QTL data (eQTL/pQTL/sQTL) or colocalization, and those have not been declared in the configuration, use the reduced formula (e.g., DEG ∩ MR only) and note the limitation.

---

## Upgrade-Only Module Labeling

When the Step-by-Step Workflow for Advanced or Publication+ introduces a module not present in Lite/Standard, label it explicitly:

```
[UPGRADE-ONLY — Advanced+]
Module: e.g., Colocalization (coloc)
Newly Introduced: Yes
Reason for Addition: Rules out LD confounding; elevates causal evidence tier
New Evidence Tier Enabled: Causal-level (same variant drives eQTL + GWAS)
```

Do not back-propagate upgrade-only modules into the Lite or Standard sections.
