# scientific-thinking-biology — Structured Scientific Reasoning for Biology & Life Science

[中文文档](README_CN.md)

A biology-specific adaptation of [scientific-thinking-general](https://github.com/Agents365-ai/scientific-thinking-skill), with domain-specific reasoning layers for molecular biology, genetics, genomics, cell biology, immunology, neuroscience, ecology, and all life science research.

## What it does

- Anchors reasoning to the correct biological level (molecular → cellular → tissue → organism → evolutionary)
- Distinguishes marker from driver, correlation from causation, enrichment from mechanism
- Evaluates the experimental system: in vitro / in vivo / ex vivo / clinical relevance and limits
- Applies a biological evidence hierarchy (genetic perturbation > biochemical > pharmacological > correlative omics)
- Flags biology-specific confounders: redundancy, compensation, composition bias, model organism gaps, overexpression artifacts, batch effects
- Calibrates claim language to evidence strength using biology-appropriate language
- Defines interpretation boundaries: species scope, cell type scope, disease context
- Suggests the lowest-cost next experiment that would discriminate between explanations

## Multi-Platform Support

Works with all major AI agents that support the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format:

| Platform | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Full support | Native SKILL.md format |
| **OpenClaw / ClawHub** | ✅ Full support | `metadata.openclaw` namespace |
| **Hermes Agent** | ✅ Full support | `metadata.hermes` namespace, category: research |
| **Pi-Mo** | ✅ Full support | `metadata.pimo` namespace |
| **SkillsMP** | ✅ Indexed | GitHub topics configured |

## Comparison: with vs. without this skill

| Capability | Native agent | This skill |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| Distinguish marker from driver | No | Yes — requires functional perturbation |
| Evaluate experimental system | No | Yes — in vitro / in vivo / clinical |
| Apply biological evidence hierarchy | No | Yes — 8-level hierarchy |
| Flag model organism translation gap | No | Yes — species scope stated |
| Detect composition confound in omics | No | Yes — checks before concluding pathway |
| Handle null phenotypes correctly | No | Yes — redundancy/compensation considered |
| Separate enrichment from activity | No | Yes — enrichment ≠ pathway activation |
| Label claim provenance | No | Yes — data / background / inference |
| Calibrate language to evidence | No | Yes — 6-level scale |
| Suggest discriminating next experiment | No | Yes |

## When to use

- Interpreting results from cell biology, genetics, genomics, immunology, neuroscience, or any life science
- Analyzing molecular mechanisms, signaling pathways, or gene regulatory networks
- Evaluating phenotype–genotype relationships
- Designing or critiquing experimental systems
- Interpreting omics data (bulk/scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, GWAS, etc.)
- Evaluating model organism relevance and human translatability
- Constructing scientific arguments for research writing
- Reconciling conflicting findings across papers or experimental systems
- Any biology question where overclaiming a mechanism is a risk
