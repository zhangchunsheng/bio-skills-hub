## Skill boundary (Do NOT Load)

| Use **this skill** for | Use **godot-multiplayer-networking** for |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--headless` / dedicated export boot | Lobby UI, matchmaking UX, friend invites |
| ENet/DTLS host peer + safe decode | RPC signatures, `@rpc` gameplay handlers |
| Authority validation on privileged ops | MultiplayerSynchronizer / scene replication |
| Kick, health telemetry, matchmaker handoff | Client prediction, lag compensation |

**Do NOT Load** lobby/RPC tutorial scripts from multiplayer-networking when only booting a host — follow Host Golden Path here first.

## Host Golden Path (MANDATORY)

1. **Headless detect/init** — **MANDATORY** [headless_init_manager.gd](scripts/headless_init_manager.gd) (`--headless` / `dedicated_server` feature).
2. **Safe decode** — **MANDATORY** [safe_packet_decoder.gd](scripts/safe_packet_decoder.gd) before any untrusted `get_var`.
3. **Host peer** — [enet_optimized_host.gd](scripts/enet_optimized_host.gd); add [dtls_secure_server.gd](scripts/dtls_secure_server.gd) when encrypting UDP.
4. **Authority** — [server_authority_validator.gd](scripts/server_authority_validator.gd) on every privileged RPC.
5. **Ops** — [peer_kick_manager.gd](scripts/peer_kick_manager.gd), [server_health_exporter.gd](scripts/server_health_exporter.gd); matchmaker handoff via [server_matchmaker_client.gd](scripts/server_matchmaker_client.gd).

## Available Scripts

### [headless_init_manager.gd](scripts/headless_init_manager.gd)
Detect/initialize dedicated server logic for `--headless` / `dedicated_server`.

### [headless_manager.gd](scripts/headless_manager.gd)
Headless runtime manager companion patterns.

### [enet_optimized_host.gd](scripts/enet_optimized_host.gd)
High-performance ENet UDP hosts with bandwidth/client limits.

### [dtls_secure_server.gd](scripts/dtls_secure_server.gd)
DTLS + X509 hardening for ENet UDP.

### [safe_packet_decoder.gd](scripts/safe_packet_decoder.gd)
Forbid object decoding on untrusted packets (RCE guard).

### [manual_network_poll.gd](scripts/manual_network_poll.gd)
Manual `multiplayer.poll()` when auto-poll is disabled.

### [isolated_multiplayer_api.gd](scripts/isolated_multiplayer_api.gd)
Isolated MultiplayerAPI instances (client+server in one process).

### [server_authority_validator.gd](scripts/server_authority_validator.gd)

### [server_matchmaker_client.gd](scripts/server_matchmaker_client.gd)
Load-balancer / matchmaker handoff to game hosts.

### [server_health_exporter.gd](scripts/server_health_exporter.gd)
Headless telemetry for monitoring stacks.

### [physics_server_direct.gd](scripts/physics_server_direct.gd) / [rid_performance_server.gd](scripts/rid_performance_server.gd)
Optional host-side RID sim — **only when** node physics cannot hold tick budget: > ~200 active bodies per tick, or headless host CPU > 70% on physics step with nodes. Criteria: profile first; if SceneTree bodies dominate, prefer [godot-performance-optimization](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-performance-optimization/SKILL.md). **Do NOT Load** RID scripts for ≤64 entity lobbies.

## NEVER Do in Server Architecture (Host)

- **NEVER trust the client** — Validate state, purchases, and damage on the authoritative host.
- **NEVER use `TRANSFER_MODE_RELIABLE` for continuous streams** — Prefer unreliable for high-rate transforms.
- **NEVER use `get_var(true)` on untrusted packets** — Object decode = RCE. **MANDATORY** safe_packet_decoder.
- **NEVER use TCP for fast-paced action** — Prefer ENet UDP (or WebSocket for HTML5 constraints).
- **NEVER run a dedicated server without stripping visuals** — Dedicated Server export / dummy drivers.
- **NEVER expect RPCs before `connected_to_server` / peer ready**.
- **NEVER assume `UNRELIABLE` packets arrive in order**.
- **NEVER leave `SceneTree.multiplayer_poll` false without manual `poll()`**.
- **NEVER mix incompatible engine/multiplayer protocol versions across peers**.
- **NEVER forget `free_rid` on server-created RIDs** if the host uses Physics/RenderingServer pools.

## Host Patterns

### Interest management
Large worlds: `MultiplayerSynchronizer.public_visibility = false` + visibility filters (AABB / grid) so the host does not sync the entire world to every peer.

```gdscript
# Hook on synchronizer — filter peers by grid cell / AABB (no full tutorial)
func _visibility_filter(for_peer: int, node: Node) -> bool:
	return _interest_grid.is_visible_to_peer(for_peer, node.global_position)
# Assign: synchronizer.set_visibility_filter(_visibility_filter)
```

### Health metrics
Watch host FPS, static memory (RID leaks), and orphan counts via [server_health_exporter.gd](scripts/server_health_exporter.gd).
