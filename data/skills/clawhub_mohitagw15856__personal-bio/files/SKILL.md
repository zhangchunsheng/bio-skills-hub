# Personal Bio Skill

You never need *a* bio — you need the right length for the slot: a one-line byline, a 50-word panel
intro, a 150-word about page. Writing them separately makes them drift. This skill writes all three from
one source so they're consistent, lead with what makes you credible, and don't read like a LinkedIn cliché.

## Required Inputs

Ask for these only if they aren't already provided:

- **Name, current role/title, and company/affiliation.**
- **Your credibility anchors** — the 2–3 facts that make you worth listening to (notable work, results, recognition).
- **Focus & audience** — what you want to be known for, and where the bio will appear (conference, book, site, LinkedIn).
- **Voice** — third-person (default for bios) and/or first-person; formal vs. warm.

## Output Format

### One-liner
[Name] is a [role] who [the single most credible, specific thing]. *(for bylines, intros, Twitter)*

### Short bio (~50 words)
A tight paragraph: who you are, your strongest proof, and your focus. *(panels, author blurbs, speaker intros)*

### Long bio (~150 words)
The fuller story: role, a credibility-building arc (what you've done and the impact), what you focus on now, and a light personal/human note at the end. *(about pages, detailed intros)*

### First-person variant
The short bio rewritten in first person, for an about page or LinkedIn summary where "I" fits.

**Note** (for the user): lead every version with specificity — a concrete result or named work beats "passionate, experienced professional."

## Quality Checks

- [ ] All three lengths are present and mutually consistent (same facts, scaled)
- [ ] Each leads with a specific, credible anchor — not adjectives
- [ ] Third-person versions read naturally (start with the name, not "He/She is a passionate…")
- [ ] The long bio includes one human/personal touch so it isn't robotic
- [ ] No clichés ("results-driven", "passionate about", "thought leader") unless backed by proof

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not open with empty adjectives — "an experienced, passionate professional" says nothing; lead with the proof
- [ ] Do not make the three versions inconsistent — they should be the same story at different resolutions
- [ ] Do not stuff every accomplishment into the short bio — pick the strongest; that's what "short" means
- [ ] Do not use buzzword filler ("synergy", "thought leader") — specifics earn credibility, labels don't
- [ ] Do not forget the audience — a conference bio and a startup about-page emphasise different things

## Based On

Professional bio practice — the one-liner / short / long convention, specificity over adjectives.
