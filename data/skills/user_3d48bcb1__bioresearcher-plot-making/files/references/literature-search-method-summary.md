# Literature Search Method Summary Specification

This guide specifies the production of publication-grade figures that synthesize complex, heterogeneous biomedical literature, clinical case registers, and preclinical assay cascades into standardized vector graphics.

## 1. Provenance Architecture & Verification Protocol

Literature syntheses risk metric drift, recall errors, and false categorizations. Enforce strict verification before drawing:

1. **NCBI E-Utilities Primary Verification**:
   - Verify every PMID against NCBI E-Utilities (`esummary` / `efetch`).
   - Extract and cross-check official publication year, journal, author list, and compound identifiers.
   - *Case Lesson*: LLM recall frequently confuses adjacent PMIDs (e.g. unrelated papers or case reports). Never transcribe PMIDs from memory.
2. **Evidence Balance Principle**:
   - For every flagged safety risk or adverse event, include at least one well-tolerated benchmark or counterexample.
   - For uncharacterized areas, include dedicated "evidence gap" indicators (gray markers) rather than omitting the domain.
3. **Information Partitioning**:
   - **On-Figure**: High-level qualitative hazard descriptors, developmental stage markers, and compact PMID tags (`tag_right(ax, "PMIDs ...", y)`).
   - **In Legends (`LEGENDS.md`)**: Full quantitative cohort sizes, trial names, percentage incidences, and detailed assay parameters.

## 2. Declarative Data Contracts

Decouple literature curation from matplotlib scripts using structured TSV tables.

### Contract A: Developmental Case Register (`literature_cases.tsv`)
Represents clinical and preclinical benchmark cases mapped across development:
```tsv
entity_name	structural_tag	hazard_description	development_stage	status	pmids
Agent_Alpha	Kinase inhibitor (type II)	Grade-3 hepatotoxicity; Phase 3 terminated	phase 3	adverse_signal	00000001
Agent_Beta	Kinase inhibitor (type I)	Tolerated benchmark; 0% transaminase elevation	approved	no_signal	00000002
Agent_Gamma	Proteolysis degrader	Chronic tissue accumulation; under-reported	preclinical	under_reported	00000003
```
*Valid Stages*: `preclinical | phase 1 | phase 2 | phase 3 | approved`  
*Valid Statuses*: `adverse_signal (red) | no_signal (green) | under_reported (gray)`

### Contract B: Preclinical Detection Cascade (`assay_cascade.tsv`)
Represents orthogonal screening assays arranged in a tiered detection matrix:
```tsv
assay_name	readout	method_family	screening_stage	pmids

```
*Valid Method Families*: `in silico | proteomics | flow cytometry | biochemical | MS bioanalysis | imaging | in vivo`

### Contract C: Structured Evidence Matrix (`evidence_table.tsv`)
Represents single-panel literature landscapes:
```tsv
row_id	scope_tag	citation	journal	pmid	test_system	sample_matrix	analytical_method	readout
1	core	Author 2025	Nat Commun	00000010	Engineered kinase inhibitor	A549 cells	Phosphoproteomics	ERK pathway suppression

```
*Valid Scope Tags*: `core (amber badge) | protocol (dagger †) | transfer (double dagger ‡) | benchmark`

## 3. Visual Archetype 1: The Three-Panel Composite (180 x 120 mm)

The Three-Panel Composite pairs a biological concept schematic with an empirical case register and an assay detection matrix:

```
+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Panel a: Mechanistic Concept Diagram     | Panel b: Developmental Case Register      |
| [0.035, 0.355, 0.435, 0.585]             | [0.525, 0.355, 0.440, 0.585]              |
| - Topological cellular layout            | - Interventions + structural tags         |
| - Membrane bilayers & receptors          | - Plain-language hazard summaries         |
| - Compartments: cytosol, lysosome, mito  | - Developmental timeline dot axis         |
| - Directional trajectory of risk         | - Tri-color status dots (red/green/gray)  |
+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Panel c: Preclinical Detection Cascade Matrix Strip [0.035, 0.050, 0.930, 0.270]     |
| - Columns: Assay | What it reads out | Method Family Chip (colored) | Typical Stage  |
| - Alternating row banding (#F7F7F7) | Fixed column grid anchors                      |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Layout Rules
- **Panel a (Mechanics)**: Maintain strict biological topology. Receptors must sit within lipid bilayers with lumen/extracellular orientation preserved. Intracellular routes must terminate in bounded organelle compartments.
- **Panel b (Cases)**: Position timeline stage columns with alternating baselines ($y = 9.50$ vs $8.98$) to prevent PDF text merging. Stagger rows with a pitch of $1.35$–$1.45$ data units. Directly above the provenance footer, always render the explicit status dot glyph legend:
  ```python
  for x_pt, col, lbl in [(0.30, PALETTE["danger"], "adverse signal"),
                         (3.40, PALETTE["safe"], "no signal"),
                         (6.70, PALETTE["gap"], "under-reported")]:
      axb.plot(x_pt, 0.85, "o", color=col, ms=4.0, mec="white", mew=0.5)
      axb.text(x_pt + 0.25, 0.85, lbl, fontsize=5.2, color=col, fontweight="bold", va="center")
  ```
- **Panel c (Assays)**: Full-width strip with alternating row backgrounds (`#F7F7F7`). Method family chips use rounded boxes (`FancyBboxPatch`, rounding 0.10) with bold 5.2 pt white text. Always include the assay PMID provenance footer at valid data coordinate $y = 0.35$ (inside $[0, 10]$):
  ```python
  tag_right(axc, "assay PMIDs: " + " · ".join(unique_pmids), 0.35)
  ```

## 4. Visual Archetype 2: Single-Panel Structured Evidence Table (180 x 124–128 mm)

For emerging literature landscapes, synthesize heterogeneous study designs into an vector-rendered evidence table:

- **Single Axis**: `[0.030, 0.035, 0.940, 0.920]`
- **Header Banner**: Bold thematic title with scope qualification text.
- **Fixed Column Grid**: Allocate horizontal positions based on data complexity:
  - Column 1: Row index / scope badge
  - Column 2: Citation (`Author YYYY`), Journal, PMID
  - Column 3: Test System / Compound
  - Column 4: Sample Matrix / Cell Type
  - Column 5: Analytical Workflow
  - Column 6: Quantitative / Phenotypic Readout
- **Font-Aware Text Wrapping**: Wrap multi-line cell entries dynamically using `wrap_cell_text()` to prevent text from overflowing column bounds and failing collision audits.
- **Taxonomic Footnote**: Include explicit scope exclusions and sample boundaries at the bottom of the table.

## 5. Low-Level Matplotlib Engineering Patterns

### Dynamic Text Spacing
Proportional fonts cause character-count heuristics to fail. Always compute inline spacing using `right_edge`:
```python
from plot_helpers import right_edge

t_name = axb.text(0.15, top - 0.34, case.entity_name, fontsize=6.2, fontweight="bold")
tag_x = right_edge(axb, t_name) + 0.30
axb.text(tag_x, top - 0.34, case.structural_tag, fontsize=5.2, color="#5A5A5A")
```

### Provenance Edge Pinning
Pin citations flush against panel right edges using blended transforms:
```python
from plot_helpers import tag_right

tag_right(axa, "mechanistic anchors: PMIDs 12345678, 23456789", 0.22)
```

### Eliminating PDF Baseline Merging
When multiple headers share identical vertical coordinates, PDF extraction tools merge adjacent words into single garbled text runs. Always alternate header baselines:
```python
stages = [
    ("preclinical", 5.95, 9.50),
    ("phase 1",     7.20, 8.98),
    ("phase 3",     8.40, 9.50),
    ("approved",    9.42, 8.98),
]
for name, x, y in stages:
    axb.text(x, y, name, fontsize=5.2, color="#5A5A5A", fontweight="bold", ha="center")
```

## 6. Literature Summary QA Gate Checklist

Before certifying any literature summary figure for release, verify:

- [ ] Every PMID is validated against NCBI E-Utilities (`esummary`/`efetch`).
- [ ] At least one tolerated counterexample and any evidence gaps are explicitly displayed.
- [ ] Script resolves paths via `Path(__file__).resolve().parent`.
- [ ] Biological topology is correct (bilayers, organelles, flow directions).
- [ ] Column header baselines are staggered to prevent PDF text merging.
- [ ] Inline text runs are spaced using `right_edge` dynamic metrics.
- [ ] Table cells are wrapped using `wrap_cell_text` (no column overflow).
- [ ] Figure passes `require_matplotlib_panel_alignment` with deviation $\le 1.5\text{ pt}$.
- [ ] Vector PDF passes `audit_figure_collisions.py` with 0 FAIL.
- [ ] All rendered text meets the $\ge 5.0\text{ pt}$ font size floor.
