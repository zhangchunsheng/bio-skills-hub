## Dependency Map Deliverable (mandatory)

Every output must include a **Dependency Map / Evidence Map** as part of Section C.5.

### Required Format

```
Evidence Map — [Config Name]

PRESENT evidence layers:
- [list each declared data source and analysis method]

ABSENT evidence layers:
- [list what is NOT included in this configuration]

THEREFORE FORBIDDEN steps:
- [list downstream steps that cannot appear due to absent dependencies]

Evidence-claim formula used:
- [state the exact claim formula, e.g. prognosis + immune context only / computational drug sensitivity only]
```
