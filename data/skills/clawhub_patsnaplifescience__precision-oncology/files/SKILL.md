## MCP Connectivity Check

**Before processing any user query after this skill loads, the following connectivity check MUST be performed.**

1. Probe MCP connectivity with a lightweight tool call, e.g. query the known target `EGFR`:
   - Use `ls_target_fetch` to look up EGFR by name
   - If valid data is returned → MCP is connected, proceed to the user's query
2. If the call fails (tool not found, connection timeout, auth error, etc.):
   - **Stop immediately** — do not attempt other MCP tools
   - Do not continue after reporting errors — this will trigger repeated failures
   - Reply to the user with the following guidance:

### 4. Business Development Domain

- **Company data**: ls_organization_fetch

---

**Important**: Preferentially use the lifesciences MCP service for data retrieval. Consider other sources only when MCP
cannot fulfill the requirements.

**Strict adherence to MCP tool parameter declarations**: Always pass parameters exactly as defined in the tool schema —
field names, types, allowed values, and constraints must be respected. Do not omit, rename, or infer parameters not
explicitly declared.

**Obey Following Tool Calling Policies**

1. If _search tool returns no more than 100 results, and there's corresponding _fetch tool, ALWAYS call _fetch tool with
   whole search result IDs, not just pick some.

## Execution Principles

### Principle 0: Search → Fetch Pattern

There are two ways to retrieve entity details:

1. **Search → Fetch**: Search to get IDs, then fetch details
2. **Direct Fetch**: When entity name or ID is already known, fetch details directly

Do not make judgments based solely on summaries — always execute the fetch step.

---

### Principle 1: Problem Analysis First

Before selecting tools, analyze:

1. What indication is the user interested in, and which regions are targeted?
2. What types of data are needed? (patents, literature, drugs, targets, companies, etc.)
3. Corresponding epidemiology and commercial reports
4. Is cross-domain data integration required?

**Example scenario 1**: "NSCLC"

```
- Disease: NSCLC
```

**Example scenario 2**: "Incidence of diabetes in the United States"

```
- Disease: diabetes
- Region: United States
```

**Example scenario 3**: "Myopia intervention for adolescents in China"

```
- Disease: myopia
- Region: China
- Population: adolescents
```

### Principle 2: Search Strategy — Precision First, Fallback as Needed

Multi-Path Recall Strategy: Condition Search (structured parameters) as primary, Vector Search as secondary fallback.

**Good Case (Multi-Path Recall):**

```
Firstly: Call ls_X_search(target="STAT3", disease="pancreatic cancer", limit=20)
  <- always start with condition search; if results are sufficient, stop here
Secondly: Call ls_X_search(target="STAT3", limit=20)
  <- Try to change search conditions if no matches
  ...
<Stop if condition search returns enough results>
  ...
Finally: Call ls_X_vector_search(query="STAT3 cancer stemness mechanism")
  <- vector search only condition searches return not enough results
```

**Bad Case:**

```
❌ Firstly: Call ls_X_vector_search(query="STAT3 inhibitor")
   <- Directly use vector search tool is not expected
```

**Important**:

- ID lists are only indexes — **they do not contain substantive information**
- **Must** call detail tools to retrieve full content
- Analysis and answers can only be provided after fetching details

### Principle 3: Flexible Tool Combination

Based on the analysis in Principle 1, **only execute the PATHs relevant to the user's question** — do not default to
executing all paths.
**Stop condition**: When the data already collected is sufficient to answer the user's question, **stop retrieval
immediately**.

**Example scenario 1**: "Which companies are developing EGFR inhibitors?"
Requires cross-domain data: drug data + company data.

- Search for EGFR-related drugs, fetch details to get organization IDs, then fetch company information

**Example scenario 2**: "Patent and clinical research status of PD-1 antibodies"
Requires cross-domain data: patent data + literature data.

- Search and fetch patent information; search and fetch literature information; integrate both into the analysis

### Principle 4: Output Format Requirements

Each section should be numbered with uppercase Roman numerals; each part within a section with lowercase Roman numerals.

```
Title
├──Abstract
├──Section I: Intro
├──Section II: XXXXXX
│   ├──Part i
│   │   ├──1.
│   │   └──2.
│   └──Part ii
├──...
└──Section V: Conclusion
```

A conclusion section is mandatory. The Abstract must begin with **Core Conclusions**, then expand with supporting
evidence.

### Principle 5: Web Search Tool Usage

**Core constraint: web search may only be called after all MCP database retrievals are complete.**

**When to use**: After completing Condition Search and Vector Search, assess whether the results are sufficient from
three dimensions:

| Dimension             | Description                                                                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Coverage completeness | Does it cover all key points of the user's query?                                          |
| Data depth            | Is there sufficient detail and data to support the answer?                                 |
| Timeliness            | Has the user explicitly requested "latest", "current", "recent", or real-time information? |

**Decision Rules:**

- Database results sufficiently cover user needs → generate report directly; do NOT call web search
- Database results are empty, severely insufficient, or user explicitly requests latest developments → use web search,
  then integrate results into the report
- Web search may be called multiple times as needed

**Query Strategy for Clinical Dynamics:**
Web search supplements — not replaces — MCP database search. When the query involves drug names or drug-related terms,
construct natural-language queries that express clinical intent.

| Scenario                     | Query Pattern                                  | Example                                             |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Drug clinical status         | "clinical development {drug}"                  | "clinical development napabucasin"                  |
| Drug clinical trials results | "Phase III clinical trial {drug} results"      | "Phase III clinical trial napabucasin results"      |
| Drug safety and dose         | "{drug} safety pharmacokinetics clinical dose" | "napabucasin safety pharmacokinetics clinical dose" |
| Drug + indication clinical   | "clinical trial {drug} {indication}"           | "clinical trial napabucasin colorectal cancer"      |
| Target clinical pipeline     | "{target} clinical trial results"              | "STAT3 clinical trial results"                      |
| Biomarker clinical data      | "{drug} biomarker clinical"                    | "napabucasin biomarker pSTAT3 clinical"             |

Keep queries concise and precise — avoid generic meta-words like "review", "report", "landscape", or "pipeline
overview".

**Query Construction:**

- **First turn**: Use the user's original question as the search query
- **Multi-turn dialogue**: Synthesize context from the full conversation into an effective search query
- **Language preservation**: Keep the user's language preference in the query

**Prohibited
**: Calling web search before all MCP database retrievals are complete; defaulting without evaluating necessity.

## Report Summary

The report **must** include a conclusion section at the end:

1. Summary of the tumor's physiological mechanisms
2. New therapies and drug types for the disease or different mutations
3. Shortcomings of standard therapy: poor efficacy or adverse reactions/ADR
4. More cost-effective treatment options
5. Patient population and market growth

### Prohibited Actions

1. Vague expressions such as "possibly", "perhaps", "further research is recommended" are not allowed in conclusions,
   unless data is genuinely insufficient
2. Do **not** add "Report generation date", "Disclaimer", "Report completion date", "Data sources", or "Based on
   data/literature from year X" at the end
3. Do not repeat content already detailed in the report body within the conclusion — only output core judgments
4. Do not mention execution workflows or plans in the output report
5. Do not speculate or fabricate when information is insufficient
6. Do not over-execute — stop once information clearly covers the user's question
