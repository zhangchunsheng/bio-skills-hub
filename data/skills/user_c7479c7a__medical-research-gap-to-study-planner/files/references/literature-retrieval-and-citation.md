# Literature Retrieval and Citation Standard
# medical-research-gap-to-study-planner

## Purpose

The literature layer in this skill exists to support protocol design decisions, not to decorate the output.
The goal is to justify:
- why the gap matters,
- why the selected pattern is appropriate,
- which methods are canonical or well-accepted,
- and what comparable precedent studies have already done.

---

## Preferred Retrieval Order

1. **PubMed** — biomedical anchor for disease and method literature
2. **Google Scholar** — recall expansion, citation chaining, and comparable-study discovery
3. **Web of Science** — citation-network and indexed-literature support
4. **arXiv and other preprint platforms** — preprint-only evidence, clearly labeled
5. **PubMed.ai** — AI-assisted retrieval or summarization support; not a substitute for underlying citation verification

---

## Mandatory Rules

- Never fabricate citations
- Never invent PMID, PMCID, DOI, title, journal, year, authors, or links
- Only list a paper as a formal reference if it has been directly verified against a trustworthy source
- Separate **peer-reviewed** evidence from **preprint** evidence
- If a reference cannot be sufficiently verified, do not promote it to the formal list
- If browsing/search is unavailable, explicitly state that limitation and provide a search strategy instead

---

## Minimum Design-Support Reference Targets

For the recommended protocol, aim to retrieve:
- 2–4 gap-background or disease-context references
- 1–2 core method / design-support references for modules actually used
- 1–2 similar-study precedent references
- 1 explicit note on what is still missing from the literature

---

## Formal Reference Output Format

Each formal reference should include as many of the following as can be directly verified:
- authors or consortium name
- article title
- journal or repository
- year
- DOI and/or PMID / PMCID / stable publisher link
- evidence label: peer-reviewed or preprint
- why it matters for this protocol

---

## Evidence-Gap Note Requirement

In addition to references, include one short explicit note such as:

> "No directly verified precedent was identified for [specific design bridge], suggesting that this step remains relatively underdeveloped in the current literature."

This note is required whenever a design component lacks strong precedent support.
