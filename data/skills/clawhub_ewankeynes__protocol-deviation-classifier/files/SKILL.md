# Protocol Deviation Classifier

Clinical trial protocol deviation classification tool, based on GCP and ICH E6 guidelines, automatically determines whether deviations belong to "major deviations" or "minor deviations".

## Features

- **Automatic Classification**: Automatically determines severity based on deviation description
- **Risk Assessment**: Assesses impact on subject safety, data integrity, and scientific validity
- **Regulatory Basis**: Classification basis complies with GCP, ICH E6, and FDA/EMA guidelines
- **Report Generation**: Generates deviation classification reports that meet regulatory requirements
- **Chinese Support**: Full support for Chinese clinical trial scenarios

## Deviation Classification Standards

### Major/Critical Deviation

Deviations that may affect trial data integrity, subject safety, or trial scientific validity:

| Category | Examples |
|------|------|
| Informed Consent | Performing research procedures without informed consent, using expired/incorrect informed consent forms |
| Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria | Enrolling subjects who don't meet inclusion criteria, enrolling subjects who meet exclusion criteria |
| Investigational Product | Overdose administration, contraindicated concomitant medication, incorrect route of administration, randomization error |
| Safety | Not performing safety monitoring as required by protocol, missing SAE/SUSAR reports, delayed reporting |
| Blinding | Unblinding by unauthorized personnel, unrecorded emergency unblinding procedures |
| Data Integrity | Falsifying/fabricating data, systematic missing of critical data |
| Prohibited Operations | Violating key operational procedures of trial protocol, not performing key efficacy assessments |

### Minor Deviation

Deviations unlikely to affect trial data integrity, subject safety, or trial scientific validity:

| Category | Examples |
|------|------|
| Visit Window | Slightly exceeding visit time window (e.g., within a few days), delay of non-critical visits |
| Sample Collection | Minor timing deviations in non-critical sample collection, slight delays in sample processing |
| Questionnaire Completion | Quality of life questionnaires/diary cards submitted a few days late |
| Data Recording | Delays in non-critical data recording, spelling/formatting errors |
| Procedure Execution | Adjustment of secondary procedure execution order, omission of non-critical assessments (e.g., height measurement) |
| Documentation | Delays in source document signatures, missing secondary documents (e.g., non-critical examination reports) |

## Usage

### Python API

```python
from scripts.main import DeviationClassifier

# Initialize classifier
classifier = DeviationClassifier()

# Classify single deviation
result = classifier.classify(
    description="Subject visit delayed by 2 days",
    deviation_type="Visit Window"
)
print(result.classification)  # "Minor Deviation"
print(result.confidence)      # 0.92
print(result.rationale)       # Classification rationale explanation

# Batch classification
deviations = [
    {"description": "Blood sample collected without informed consent", "type": "Informed Consent"},
    {"description": "Quality of life questionnaire submitted 3 days late", "type": "Data Collection"}
]
batch_results = classifier.classify_batch(deviations)

# Generate report
report = classifier.generate_report(batch_results)
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Classify single deviation
python scripts/main.py classify --description "Subject visit delayed by 2 days" --type "Visit Window"

# Batch classification from file
python scripts/main.py batch --input deviations.json --output report.json

# Interactive classification
python scripts/main.py interactive

# Assess deviation impact
python scripts/main.py assess \
  --description "Subject accidentally took double dose of investigational drug" \
  --safety-impact high \
  --data-impact medium \
  --scientific-impact medium
```

### Input Format

**JSON Input File Format:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "DEV-001",
    "description": "Subject visit delayed by 2 days",
    "type": "Visit Window",
    "occurrence_date": "2024-01-15",
    "severity_factors": {
      "safety_impact": "none",
      "data_impact": "low",
      "scientific_impact": "low"
    }
  },

    "id": "DEV-002",
    "description": "Blood collection performed without informed consent",
    "type": "Informed Consent",
    "severity_factors": {
      "safety_impact": "high",
      "data_impact": "high",
      "scientific_impact": "high"
    }
  }
]
```

### Output Format

**Classification Result:**

```json

  "classification": "Minor Deviation",
  "classification_en": "Minor Deviation",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "rationale": "Visit time window slightly delayed (2 days), does not affect subject safety, data integrity, or trial scientific validity.",
  "risk_factors": {
    "safety_risk": "none",
    "data_integrity_risk": "low",
    "scientific_validity_risk": "none"
  },
  "regulatory_basis": [
    "ICH E6(R2) Section 4.5",
    "GCP Section 6.4.4"
  ],
  "recommended_actions": [
    "Document in file",
    "Track trends"
  ]
}
```

## Classification Algorithm

Classification based on the following assessment dimensions:

1. **Subject Safety Impact** (Safety Impact)
   - None: No impact
   - Low: Minor impact
   - Medium: Moderate impact
   - High: Serious impact

2. **Data Integrity Impact** (Data Integrity Impact)
   - None: No impact
   - Low: Minor impact on non-critical data
   - Medium: Partial impact on critical data
   - High: Serious damage to critical data

3. **Trial Scientific Validity Impact** (Scientific Validity Impact)
   - None: No impact
   - Low: Minor impact on statistical power
   - Medium: May affect primary endpoint
   - High: Seriously affects trial conclusion

**Classification Rules:**
- Any dimension is High → Major Deviation
- Safety dimension is Medium and Data/Science either is Medium+ → Major Deviation
- Other cases → Minor Deviation

## Notes

1. This tool provides classification recommendations, final determination must be confirmed by clinical quality assurance personnel
2. Serious/critical deviations must be reported to sponsor and ethics committee immediately
3. It is recommended to regularly review deviation trends and implement CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Actions)
4. Classification standards may vary by regulatory agency, trial type, and protocol requirements
