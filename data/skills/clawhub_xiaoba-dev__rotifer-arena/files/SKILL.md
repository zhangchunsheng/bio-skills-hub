  One-click Gene comparison and evaluation for Rotifer Protocol. Import from ClawHub Skills,
  local files, or build from scratch — automatically compile, match opponents, run Arena
  battles, and generate structured Markdown reports.
  Use when the user mentions "compare", "evaluate", "challenge", "compete", "Arena",
  "benchmark", "which is better", "Gene comparison", "Skill comparison", "scenario", "reference case".

# Rotifer Arena — Gene Comparison & Evaluation

> One Skill covering Gene/Genome/Agent comparison across all scenarios.

## Prerequisites

This Skill requires the Rotifer CLI:

```bash
npx @rotifer/playground --version
```

Or use the MCP Server for IDE integration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rotifer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@rotifer/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Overview

This Skill wraps Rotifer Protocol's core value — **objective, quantifiable capability evaluation** — into a one-click workflow. Users don't need to understand Gene, Arena, or F(g) concepts upfront; the Skill introduces them naturally during execution.

**Cross-platform**: This SKILL.md runs in any AI development environment that supports Skills/Agents.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identify Evaluation Target

Understand user intent through conversation and determine the evaluation mode:

| User signal | Mode | Action |
|-------------|------|--------|
| "Evaluate the X skill from ClawHub" | **ClawHub migration evaluation** | `rotifer wrap <name> --from-clawhub <slug>` |
| "Compare my two implementations" | **Local comparison** | Confirm both Gene names, skip to Phase 3 |
| "I have a Skill I want to test" | **Skill import evaluation** | `rotifer wrap <name> --from-skill <path>` |
| "Help me build a XX scenario" | **Scenario scaffolding** | Guide Gene creation (`rotifer init` or manual phenotype) |

**If the user doesn't specify a domain**: auto-read from phenotype.json, or guide the user to choose.

### Phase 2: Compile & Verify

```bash
rotifer compile <gene-name>
```

Output guidance based on fidelity result:
- **Wrapped**: Verification passed, deterministic evaluation mode
- **Hybrid/Native**: WASM compilation, real sandbox execution mode (requires NAPI binding)

### Phase 3: Automatic Opponent Matching

**Priority order**:

1. **User-specified**: If the user says "compare X and Y", use those directly
2. **Same-domain local search**: Highest-ranked Gene from `rotifer arena list --domain <domain>`
3. **Same-fidelity preferred**: If target is Wrapped, prefer Wrapped opponents (avoid cross-fidelity blowouts)
4. **No opponent found**: Inform the user, show current cross-domain Arena rankings for reference

**Opponent selection requires user confirmation** — show candidate F(g) and fidelity.

### Phase 4: Arena Submit & Compare

```bash
rotifer arena submit <gene-a>
rotifer arena submit <gene-b>
rotifer arena list --domain <domain>
```

Collect evaluation results for both Genes.

### Phase 5: Generate Evaluation Report

**Output the full report in the conversation** (rendered Markdown).
Append at the end: `> Reply "save" to write the report to arena-reports/`.
When the user replies "save", write to `<project>/arena-reports/<date>-<gene-a>-vs-<gene-b>.md`.

**Report format requirements**:

1. **Title = conclusion**: Use scenario name + both Gene names, not a generic title
2. **Conclusion first**: Immediately below the title, a `>` blockquote with one-sentence summary of winner and key data
3. **Concise comparison table**: Only decision-relevant metrics (rank, F(g), V(g), Fidelity, success rate, latency, source), bold the winner
4. **Ranking visualization**: Fixed-width ASCII table showing the full domain ranking, mark new entries with `←`
5. **Reproduction commands in a standalone bash block**: Pure commands (no comments/output) for easy copy-paste
6. **No internal references**: No ADR numbers, plan section numbers, or internal version notes
7. **Minimal metadata**: One line at the bottom with date + CLI version + evaluation mode

**Report structure** (output directly in conversation):

- **Title**: `# <scenario> Comparison: <Gene A> vs <Gene B>`
- **Conclusion blockquote**: One sentence — who won, key metric delta, core reason
- **Comparison table**: Rank, F(g), V(g), Fidelity, Success rate, Latency score, Source
- **Current ranking**: Full domain leaderboard (ASCII table, `←` marks new entries)
- **Analysis**: 2–3 paragraphs on fitness gap attribution, security comparison, same-fidelity positioning
- **Upgrade path**: Table with path / action / expected improvement / effort
- **Reproduction steps**: 4–5 pure CLI commands
- **Next steps**: 4 commands with brief descriptions
- **Footer**: `Generated on YYYY-MM-DD · @rotifer/playground@X.Y.Z · Mode: deterministic estimation`

## Scenario Examples

### Example 1: Evaluate a ClawHub Skill's Competitiveness

```text
User: Evaluate the web-search skill from ClawHub in the Rotifer ecosystem

Skill execution:
1. rotifer wrap clawhub-web-search --from-clawhub web-search -d search
2. rotifer compile clawhub-web-search
3. Auto-discover same-domain opponent: genesis-web-search (Native, F(g)=0.9470)
4. rotifer arena submit clawhub-web-search
5. Generate comparison report
```

### Example 2: Compare Two Custom Genes

```text
User: Compare my particle-brute and particle-spatial — which is better?

Skill execution:
1. Confirm both Genes exist with phenotype.json
2. rotifer arena submit particle-brute
3. rotifer arena submit particle-spatial
4. rotifer arena list --domain sim.particle
5. Generate comparison report
```

### Example 3: Build a Quantitative Scenario

```text
User: Help me build a quantitative strategy comparison scenario

Skill execution:
1. Guide user to define domain (e.g. quant.strategy)
2. Guide creation of two Gene phenotype.json files (Strategy A vs Strategy B)
3. If compilable source exists, compile to WASM
4. rotifer arena submit both Genes
5. Generate scenario comparison report
```

## Prerequisites

- Project has a `rotifer.json` (if not, guide `rotifer init`)
- CLI is built (`npm run build` in rotifer-playground)
- ClawHub imports require network connectivity

## Related Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `gene-dev` | Route here when users need to create a Gene from scratch |
| `gene-migration` | Route here when the report recommends a fidelity upgrade |
| `gene-audit` | Suggest running when the report shows low security scores |

## Constraints

- **No automatic Cloud publishing**: Comparison evaluation is a local operation; Cloud publishing requires explicit user confirmation
- **Cross-fidelity comparisons need a disclaimer**: The baseFitness gap between Wrapped and Native comes from the scoring model, not actual capability differences
- **Reports are Markdown format**: Ready for blogs, community sharing, or GitHub Issues
