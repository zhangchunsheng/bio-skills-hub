## MCP Connectivity Check

**Before processing any user query after this skill loads, the following connectivity check MUST be performed.**

1. Probe MCP connectivity with a lightweight tool call, e.g. query the known target `EGFR`:
   - Use `ls_target_fetch` to look up EGFR by name
   - If valid data is returned → MCP is connected, proceed to the user's query
2. If the call fails (tool not found, connection timeout, auth error, etc.):
   - **Stop immediately** — do not attempt other MCP tools
   - Do not continue after reporting errors — this will trigger repeated failures
   - Reply to the user with the following guidance:

**Important**: Preferentially use the lifesciences MCP service for data retrieval. Consider other sources only when MCP
cannot fulfill the requirements.

**Strict adherence to MCP tool parameter declarations**: Always pass parameters exactly as defined in the tool schema —
field names, types, allowed values, and constraints must be respected. Do not omit, rename, or infer parameters not
explicitly declared.

**Obey Following Tool Calling Policies**

1. If _search tool returns no more than 100 results, and there's corresponding _fetch tool, ALWAYS call _fetch tool with
   whole search result IDs, not just pick some.

---

## Execution Principles

### Principle 0: Search → Fetch Pattern

There are two ways to retrieve entity details:

1. **Search → Fetch**: Search to get IDs, then fetch details
2. **Direct Fetch**: When entity name or ID is already known, fetch details directly

Do not make judgments based solely on summaries — always execute the fetch step.

### Principle 1: Problem Analysis First

Before initiating data retrieval, analyze:

1. What disease/indication is the user interested in, and which regions are targeted?
2. What types of information are needed? (mechanisms, treatments, pipeline, patents, market, deals, etc.)
3. What is the epidemiological and commercial context?
4. Is cross-domain data integration required?

**Example analysis**:

- "NSCLC" → Disease: NSCLC
- "Incidence of diabetes in the United States" → Disease: diabetes, Region: United States
- "PD-1/PD-L1 patent landscape" → Target: PD-1/PD-L1, Domain: Intellectual Property
- "ADC licensing deals in China" → Domain: Business Development, Technology: ADC, Region: China

### Principle 2: Search Strategy — Precision First, Fallback as Needed

Multi-Path Recall Strategy: Condition Search (structured parameters) as primary, Vector Search as secondary fallback.

**Good Case (Multi-Path Recall):**

```
Firstly: Call ls_X_search(target="STAT3", disease="pancreatic cancer", limit=20)
  <- always start with condition search; if results are sufficient, stop here
Secondly: Call ls_X_search(target="STAT3", limit=20)
  <- Try to change search conditions if no matches
  ...
<Stop if condition search returns enough results>
  ...
Finally: Call ls_X_vector_search(query="STAT3 cancer stemness mechanism")
  <- vector search only condition searches return not enough results
```

**Bad Case:**

```
❌ Firstly: Call ls_X_vector_search(query="STAT3 inhibitor")
   <- Directly use vector search tool is not expected
```

### Principle 3: Targeted Investigation Based on User Needs

Based on the analysis, **execute only the investigation paths relevant to the user's question**.

**Stop condition**: When collected data is sufficient to answer the question, **stop retrieval immediately**.

### Principle 4: Output Format Requirements

Each section should be numbered with uppercase Roman numerals; each part within a section with lowercase Roman numerals.

```
Title
├──Abstract
├──Section I: Intro
├──Section II: XXXXXX
│   ├──Part i
│   │   ├──1.
│   │   └──2.
│   └──Part ii
├──...
└──Section V: Conclusion
```

A conclusion section is mandatory. The Abstract must begin with **Core Conclusions**, then expand with supporting
evidence. Include key evidence references and identifiers where applicable.

---

### Principle 5: Web Search Tool Usage

**Core constraint: web search may only be called after all MCP database retrievals are complete.**

**When to use**: After completing Condition Search and Vector Search, assess whether the results are sufficient from
three dimensions:

| Dimension             | Description                                                                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Coverage completeness | Does it cover all key points of the user's query?                                          |
| Data depth            | Is there sufficient detail and data to support the answer?                                 |
| Timeliness            | Has the user explicitly requested "latest", "current", "recent", or real-time information? |

**Decision Rules:**

- Database results sufficiently cover user needs → generate report directly; do NOT call web search
- Database results are empty, severely insufficient, or user explicitly requests latest developments → use web search,
  then integrate results into the report
- Web search may be called multiple times as needed

**Query Strategy for Clinical Dynamics:**
Web search supplements — not replaces — MCP database search. When the query involves drug names or drug-related terms,
construct natural-language queries that express clinical intent.

| Scenario                     | Query Pattern                                  | Example                                             |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Drug clinical status         | "clinical development {drug}"                  | "clinical development napabucasin"                  |
| Drug clinical trials results | "Phase III clinical trial {drug} results"      | "Phase III clinical trial napabucasin results"      |
| Drug safety and dose         | "{drug} safety pharmacokinetics clinical dose" | "napabucasin safety pharmacokinetics clinical dose" |
| Drug + indication clinical   | "clinical trial {drug} {indication}"           | "clinical trial napabucasin colorectal cancer"      |
| Target clinical pipeline     | "{target} clinical trial results"              | "STAT3 clinical trial results"                      |
| Biomarker clinical data      | "{drug} biomarker clinical"                    | "napabucasin biomarker pSTAT3 clinical"             |

Keep queries concise and precise — avoid generic meta-words like "review", "report", "landscape", or "pipeline
overview".

**Query Construction:**

- **First turn**: Use the user's original question as the search query
- **Multi-turn dialogue**: Synthesize context from the full conversation into an effective search query
- **Language preservation**: Keep the user's language preference in the query

**Prohibited
**: Calling web search before all MCP database retrievals are complete; defaulting without evaluating necessity.

## Research Path Modules

### PATH 1: Scientific Basis

- Investigate disease mechanisms using literature and scientific publications
- Identify and research relevant biological targets and their role in the disease

### PATH 2: Epidemiology

- Search for epidemiological data using disease entities and regional/population parameters
- Summarize incidence, prevalence, and demographic patterns

### PATH 3: Standard of Care Investigation

**Pay special attention** to different therapies used under different "molecular mutation types"

- Search for standard therapies using disease keywords in literature
- Identify approved drugs and their details
- Retrieve clinical trials for Phase 3 and Phase 4 completed studies
- Gather clinical trial results and efficacy reports
- Synthesize evidence from literature and trial data

Efficacy indicators may include:

- Survival rates, including relative survival rate, PFS, and ORR
- Physiological indicators as surrogate endpoints — quantitative (e.g., tumor size, blood pressure, viral load) or
  qualitative (e.g., subjective experience)
- Statistical measures: risk reduction, hazard ratio, NNT
- Patient-reported outcomes: quality of life scores, pain scores, time to remission

### PATH 4: Pipeline & Breakthrough Investigation

- Investigate clinical trials using disease as filter, focusing on Phase 2 and Phase 3 (maturing but incomplete
  development)
- Verify drug approval status in retrieved trials
- Retrieve clinical trial results and outcomes
- Search for novel therapies and technological innovations

In addition to efficacy indicators (as in PATH 3), summarize the main innovations of new therapies, which may include:

- Targeting a completely new subtype or target
- Using a new drug type or molecular structure for lower side effects or better efficacy
- Larger dosing window or longer intervals due to improved MoA or formulation

### PATH 5: Commercial Intelligence

- Search for market reports using disease keywords
- Investigate licensing deals and partnerships in the therapeutic area
- Assess unmet medical needs: patient willingness to pay, treatment urgency (life-threatening vs. quality of life)
- Evaluate market dynamics: assess market size and pricing based on epidemiological data
    - High price, low volume: consider rare disease
    - Low price, low volume: abandon
    - High price, high volume: proceed
    - Low price, high volume: likely chronic disease, consider insurance/government healthcare coverage

## Report Summary

The report must follow the output format requirements. Conclusion section must include:

1. Novel therapies and drug types for the disease
2. Shortcomings of standard therapy: poor efficacy or adverse reactions
3. More cost-effective treatment options
4. Patient population and market growth

### Report Verification

- Conclusions must be based on retrieved data; avoid vague expressions ("possibly", "further research recommended")
- Do not fabricate data or information
- When information is insufficient, state clearly rather than speculate
- Conclusions should only provide core judgments, not repeat body content
