# Stage → cheapest credits-based action map

Canonical reference for picking the cheapest credits-based action per GTM stage across the full 120-integration cargo catalog. Use this when the priority-stack default doesn't have what you need.

Prices are credits/record. "Priority?" marks providers in the priority stack (salesNavigator / cargo / waterfall / FullEnrich / theirStack / peopleDataLabs).

## Notes on this map

- All 141 credits-based actions documented. Free CRUD actions (sequencer / CRM upserts, list/get/delete) not shown — they don't consume credits.
- Costs are per-record at the cheapest config. Some actions have variable cost by config (e.g., `contactOut.enrich` returns 0/1/2/3 credits depending on data returned).
- Priority stack: see `../SKILL.md` for the canonical 6-provider priority list and `../provider-playbooks/` for per-provider deep dives.
